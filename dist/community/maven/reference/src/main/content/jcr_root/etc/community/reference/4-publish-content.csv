The twist and lock poles are kind of an outdated technology as far as poles are concerned. The threads inside the locking mechanism are just asking to get worn out or stripped every time you make an adjustment. It's a catch 22. If you don't tighten the poles tight enough, they don't stay at the height they are supposed to. If you tighten the poles too tight, every time you do the threads will become less effective. I would recommend finding a pair of poles that have the FlickLock system. You simply pull a lever out from the pole to adjust, and then clamp it back down to tighten, much like the quick-release lever on bicycle tires and seats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's a good question that I think a lot of people overlook when shopping around for their first board, so good looking out. In addition to the Lagos being a lot lighter than a glass board, it is also way stronger which is an important consideration if you plan on being bad for a while (kidding). Overall, I recommend epoxy. It's more buoyant and if you are one to care about the environment, epoxy decomposes a lot faster than traditional glass.

Don't discount the value of a proper warm-up. If you step out in to the cold and immediately start to exert yourself too much, you are much more likely to get injured. A quick warmup and stretch can work wonders!",Dress for the weather. But not too warmly. Remember that you need to dress warmly enough to be comfortable but not so warmly that you overheat. The best strategy is to layer your clothes so you can adjust them as needed. Alpine skiers should be especially aware of this since while sitting in the chairlift you need to keep warm but when skiing down the piste may not need so much insulation.,Keep hydrated. The main mistake many people make during winter sports is to think that in the cold you don't need as much water. Nothing could be further from the truth. The best solution is to bring a long small thermos of sweetened tea. This is especially important for cross-country skiers.,"Rewards.

Also, remeber to always check for sharks!""","Ingrid: ""I grew up in the mountains so in the winter I ski, but in the summer I go hiking. Obviously the most important thing to have is a good pair of hiking boots. Make sure they have a stiff sole and lot's of ankle support.

emily.andrews@mailinator.com,0,Layer It On,"If there is one question we get the most concerning our winter sports and recreation products it's this: ""What's the best way to keep warm?"" And the answer is three simple words: ""layering, layering, layering!""",layeriton.jpg,geometrixx-outdoors:activity/skiing,Layering helps you stay warm and comfortable in a number of ways:,It traps insulating air between the layers,"It wicks away moisture from your skin, keeping you dry. And keeping dry is an important part of keeping warm.","Compared to one thick layer, multiple thiner layers let you adapt to circumstances by removing or opening an out layer when you get too hot.",In most cases three layers are optimal:,A base layer next to your skin that draws away perspiration. The most common materials for this layer are wool or synthetics like polyesther or microfibre fabrics. At Geometrixx we recommend long underwear made from Merino wool. It has excellent wicking ability combined with a natural softness that won't irritate your skin like other wools sometimes do. It is also naturally resistant to odours.,"An insulating layer. This should be made of a breatable insulation like a wool, fleece or down jacket. Depending on the situation we recommend either fleece or down. Fleece provides good insulation and absorbs very little moisture. Down on the other hand provides even better insultaion but is more absorabnt of water. For moderate cold fleece is sufficient, but in very cold dry conditions a down jacket with a thinner fleece layer underneath is the best.","A shell. The shell should be waterproof or at least water-resistant but breatable. We recommend Nortex material. It is waterproof but has micropores that allows water vapour out. In less extreme settings, a breathable polyesther shell can also be used, but these are water-resistant, not truly waterproof. Plastic raincoats and the like should be avoided. They trap moisture in your clothes and next to your skin and before long you are soaking wet and cold.",Short of Layers? Geometrixx-Outdoors has options for every need.

I turned around to see the moose charging up the small hill right in my direction. I waved my hands from behind the tree until I heard a hard thud.

andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,0,"Time to break out the sled! (Josh, you should read)","I know this may sound a bit cheesy and maybe I'm still just a kid at heart, but I love sledding! There is finally enough snow in a bowl up the canyon close to where I live that it's worth it to make the trip. Anyway, Josh, think I have found the perfect use for snowshoes. Back behind this bowl there are a bunch of snowshoe trails, and some of them get pretty steep. The great thing about the trails, though, is that they are giant one-way loops so you never face oncoming people. One of the trails gets really steep going downhill toward the end. I just got a little rocket sled that I can strap to my backpack so I can snowshoe to the top of this hill, take off my snowshoes and strap them on my backpack, and then sled down. I know. It's pretty much the greatest thing you've ever heard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

donna.billups@pookmail.com,0,Gloves: you can't be too picky,"it doesn't matter what you're up to. If its winter, and if you're outside enjoying, you are going to need a pair of quality gloves. If your hands are freezing, it doesn't matter how bundled up the rest of you is you're going to be miserable. I would recommend to the ladies that you check out the Classic leather gloves. They're made of genuine leather so you know they'll last, and so far they have done a fine job of keeping me warm.",iStock_000018434377Small.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,0,How to choose a surfboard,"I found this used surfboard from a guy online. He seems really honest and is asking for a fair price, and the board looks to be in really good shape. I have to admit this is kind of an impulse buy, and I don't know what size or shape I should get as a beginner. Any help?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,0,The Super Bowl of surfing,"Aaron thanks a ton for creating this community. I was thinking about doing the same, but then I thought that we wouldn't get the numbers. I look forward to many great discussions with you and anyone else who is passionate about surfing. I would be jealous of your trip out to Oahu, but I've got my own vacation lined up. In fact, I'm packing right now to go hang out and watch the pros at the Triple Crown. I'll get some time in on the waves, too, but I love to watch the best in the world tear it up. It's amazing what they can do. It's an art. So, I'll be in Hawaii for three weeks. In addition to the popular spots like Sunset Beach and Waimea, I also plan on hitting up the Banzai Pipeline. I have been hesitant in years past because it is a rather dangerous spot, but I'm feeling pretty confident this year. Ha ha. Kidding. I'm not going to get myself killed. I'll take pics of the pipeline but that's it. Please let me know how your trip goes and I will be sure to post some pictures when I get back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

weston.mccall@dodgit.com,0,To wax or not to wax: this is my question,"This community has got me thinking that I should give surfing a shot. When I was looking up some info about boards and apparel, I noticed that they make board wax. It looks like it's similar to what I do to my skis, but I don't get how wax would affect the board in water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"Take it from me or just about anyone else who surfs that you ask""wax your board. However, you wax the TOP of your board. This prevents your feet from slipping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weston.mccall@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"Yeah, you need to wax your board. The first time I went out, I didn't really take any advice or ask any questions. After fumbling around for a whole day, someone else in the water told me I need to wax my board. It's like night and day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,0,The El Greco,"In preparation for my upcoming trip to Hawaii, I have purchased the El Greco and taken it out a few times with my 5mm wetsuit. I have got to say, for the price it's a pretty incredible board. I plan to provide a more detailed product review later, but for now I will say that the board is very well balanced and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get into the sport!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
