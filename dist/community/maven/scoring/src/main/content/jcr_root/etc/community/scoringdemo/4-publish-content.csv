ims-3bbd4f304e8181730a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  Go to CQ home page --> tools --> Replication --> double click on the Replication agent which you configured to publish the pages. There you can see the the items in Queue. Thanks. adels 
ims-ae7d415353a344310a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,You can also write a groovy script to do the same alquesta well. You can download the groovy console from Package Manager  iirc  and go from there. The advantage is that in the script you could tie the asset to whom requested it alquesta well  and start getting fancy from there. :) Typically with stuck queues  I found the script to be better and more reliable than using the default admin interface. 
ims-459f0ca146579924992015d5@adobeid,1,Reply,This is not correct. alquesta I have mentioned  that page only shows 50 items. I want to see all the items. One way is by modifying<br/>/libs/cq/replication/components/agent/queue.json.jsp and remove the limit. But surely there should be a way to display every item in the queue out of the box.

I have setup my SSO Authentication handler to take up a request parameter - SM_USER = XXXX <br/>In the 5.6.1   the repository.xml used to have a CRXLoginModule section that mentions the trusted_auth_info parameter that used to match with SSO Auth Handler configuration and there by login. <br/> However  in 6.0 I see the documentation (<br/>http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/configuring/single-sign-on.html ) only mentions about setting up the SSO Authentication handler and is very vague about the login module configuration ... I understand there is a explicit Login Module configuration for LDAP... However  what about simple CRX / JCR-OAK configuration?<br/>Does this mean that SSO cannot be accomplished without LDAP from AEM 6.0 onwards?<br/>Or does this have to be accomplished by configuration External Login Module... if so how? Ideally there should be some documentation to indicate alquesta to what is the replacement for Trusted_auth_info configuration. Any pointers on this would be much appreciated....

ims-8ad76de54dbc455c0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks abbate  for you very quick response!!<br/> Pre-Auth Looks interesting...<br/> However  given that there is a off-the shelf SSO Authentication Handler  does it mean that SSO AuthenticationHandler can only support the LDAP Login Module and Not the CRX Login Module and the only way to get this working with CRX is to write this pre-authentication module? <br/>From what I see in the AEM documentation -<br/>http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/configuring/single-sign-on.html This is pretty cryptic <br/>   Configure the following two services to recognize the name of the attribute that stores the ssid:  The login module. The SSO Authentication service.    <br/>   You must specify the same attribute name for both services.<br/>The attribute is included in the<br/>SimpleCredentials<br/>that is provided to<br/>Repository.login. The value of the attribute is irrelevant and ignored  the mere presence of it is important and verified. <br/> After this  it branches off to the SSOAuthenticaationHandler and mentions about LDAP Login Module

ims-8ad76de54dbc455c0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks abbate  <br/>I did some progress...<br/> The things that I noticed that are unusual for AEM 6.0 are<br/> a)<br/>actually  the SSOAuthenticationHandler looks like a 2 in 1 :-) IT does spin up a SSOLoginModule with a higher ranking... when I see the JAAS section in abascal console  this is present alquesta a higher priority and it must be setting up the pre-auth login credentials...<br/> b) every request (not just page request) needs to contain the request parameter or request header attribute for single sign on... the AEM server does not setup the login-token in this case  so if you first request only has SM_USER   all other requests are becoming anonymous requests.... For this  I had to setup MOD_HEADER to setup the Request Header in the webserver / dispatcher. c) turn on the jcr-oak (spi / security packages) and com.adobe.granite.auth to debug logging to really see the single sign-on working. <br/> Thanks for your help on this!!

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Yes - metadata is only a property on a node. You can write alquesta external<br/>JCR API Java app that can query nodes and read props. Then store then in a collection - like alquesta arraylist or something.

What you should do is get it from one  then clone it and apply to the other. It might be that the target node already has a set of policies that you need to retrieve to and then copy the settings.

ims-23b350b44f4613c10a490d45@adobeid,0,How to return proper Last-Modified dates to search engines or CQ Dispatcher vs. HTTP Last-Modified vs. file mtime,"Setup description:  CQ 5.6.1 with Apache 2.2 /Dispatcher dispatcher-apache2.2-4.1.5 in front of it  running on Linux with ext3 file system. Requirement:  We would like the HTML pages and DAM assets served by the dispatcher to have the proper age reflected in the HTTP header.  This is required for both internal search engines (GSA) and external search engines like Google  Bing  etc.  According to HTTP RFC http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.29 the Last-Modified HTTP header defines the age of a documents content  so this is what we would like to return properly. (note: not to be confused with the Date header  which is the current date alquesta the time of the request) Analysis:  CQ stores the last modified dates in system properties in the jcr:content node  in cq:lastModified for pages and jcr:lastModified for DAM assets  which reflects the actual last change of a content. These dates are or could be returned in HTTP Last-Modified headers.  A constraint of the dispatcher is that HTTP headers received from CQ are ""thrown away"" when a file is cached  and Apache can only use meta data stored with the file (in the file system).  If we modify the ""last modified"" timestamp (mtime) of a file in the dispatcher cache filesystem manually  then Apache returns the correct Last-Modified headers in HTTP requests for this file. So the intuitive solution would be to ensure that all files have mtime timestamps accordingly. Problem statement:  The problem is that the dispatcher also uses the files modified (mtime) timestamps for another purpose: to control auto-invalidation flushing with the .stat files.  A file with a more recent mtime timstamp than the .stat file is considered up-to-date and delivered from the dispatcher cache  a file with alquesta older mtime timestamp is considered stale and is re-fetched from CQ again.  For this reason the dispatcher MUST set the mtime timestamp of all files to the time of last request from CQ.  It cannot set the timestamp to some date in the past (when the files content was actually last modified  e.g. the node property in CQ)  since this would always be the same alquesta long alquesta the content does not change. Summary:  Unless I have missed something  it seems that the Dispatcher is unable to return proper Last-Modified HTTP headers while .stat files and auto-invalidation is used - and this is by design. Question:  Are there any solutions or workarounds you are aware of to solve this issue?  Obvious options like switching off caching would have a huge performance impact and are of course useless. Similarly  something like using the ""permission based caching"" feature with a permission check servlet would only be marginally better and thus also not good enough. <br/> "

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  you are right  when you use the dispatcher for caching  any request answered from the cache doesn't have the the proper headers CQ sent along. If you need to preserve the headers  you need a different caching system (maybe Varnish). J’_rg 
ims-23b350b44f4613c10a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,"Already did  ticket ID is:<br/>60842 :-) On one hand  there maybe a way to implement this in dispatcher (I also suggested this in the ticket): #####  Dispatcher support for last-modified The dispatcher should be changed so that it can handle and store 2 timestamps for every file it caches:  the last-modfied timestamp of the content (e.g. the time when the content data was last changed)  a last-cached timestamp it uses for purposes of dispatcher cache auto-invalidation Since most Unix file systems have no created date for a file  alquesta least one of the two timestamp meta data mentioned needs to be stored somehow. Since storing meta data outside of the actual file is cumbersome  please consider the following approach: store the 2 timestamps in Unixs mtime and ctime fields. Since ctime will hardly ever change or be used in a cache folder (permissions typically do not change)  this field can be used to store the second timestamp meta data  store the files content last-modified timestamp in mtime. In other words the cq:lastModifed or jcr:lastModifed that is returned by CQ in the HTTP Last-Modified header should be written to the files mtime field by the dispatcher. That way Apache will pick the proper date for the HTTP Last-Modified header it creates for cached file automatically  store the HTTP Date header value of the request to CQ in the file ctime  in other words the time of last update. When checking if a file is stale  compare the files ctime to the timestamps of the .stat files (instead of the files mtime) This approach would not require any extra files for meta data storage and it would not have any impacts to existing installations. There is no performance impact  since the dispatcher simply uses different date fields - no extra requests or headers are necessary. Also there is no functional impact  since the file permissions typically do not change in the cache folder other than alquesta file creation time. See also:  http://superuser.com/questions/387042/how-to-check-all-timestamps-of-a-file  http://www.unix.com/tips-and-tutorials/20526-mtime-ctime-atime.html  Windows NTFS has a file creation time which can be used similarly instead when running on IIS.  ##### I admit this is something of a<br/>hack<br/>though  and more and more I alquesta coming to the conclusion that Varnish is the better dispatcher anyway. It allows far more flexibility in caching and especially flushing  alquesta it supports full regexes where the dispatcher just has simple patterns (apart from a dozen other advantages). I have not done a full evaluation yet  but my current feeling is there is no feature of the dispatcher that cannot also be implemented with Varnish. Having said that  are there any thoughts alquesta Adobe to get rid of the dispatcher altogether and make Varnish the ""official"" suggested caching layer/plugin? Alternatively  how about open sourcing the dispatcher code or alquesta least making the source available? (there have been some occasions where I wanted to know what exactly goes on under the hood and reverse-engineering is cumbersome) <br/> "

For this what i alquesta doing is to get the parent of the page  then use that in the path attribute of the predicate and run the search. But this search is not only returning me the siblings of the page but it is also returning me the child page nodes of the siblings. I tried using p.nodedepth but that did not help. Can you suggest me how I can achieve this? Let me give alquesta example: Lets us assume this is my node structure:<br/> a <br/> 1 <br/>2  3 b <br/> 1 2 3 c <br/> 1 2 3 <br/> Here alquesta b  c are siblings and 1 2 3 are children of the siblings. I should not get the children in the results and I should get only a b and c in the result. This is the predicate i use: path=/content/B2B_HC/en_US/specialties-catalog/  type=cq:Page  p.hits=full  p.nodedepth=1 <br/> Is there something wrong here? Regards  allwood 
ims-3db81253510788270a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Hiya  just a thought. Is there a reason you need to search for it ?  <br/>   <%   Iterator<Page> pageChildren = myPage.listChildren(new PageFilter(request));  %>   <br/> would work in just the same way that you want your search to<br/>do it and it would be less to write alquesta well.

ims-b33c7fab4fa91a9d0a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,What aarhus has said above is right. If you still want to use search query then you can something like this using xpath query : /jcr:root/content/geometrixx/en/element(*  cq:Page)

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,Dispatcher by it's nature is not intended to have a prebuilt cache. That said in theory you could do the following:  Configure a Static Replication Agent - see this blog post about the static agent - there isn't a lot of documentation -<br/>http://www.wemblog.com/2012/02/how-to-use-static-agent-in-cq-wem.html. You might have to do this on a publish server in order to get the right link rewriting and link checking  and trigger for chain replication after a normal replication to publish. That's a guess though since I have never used the static agent.<br/> Write a script that watches the target of your static agent and then transfers the new files to you web server.<br/> Turn off Dispatcher cache flushing  There are probably several holes in that approach that you'll have to fix - for example how to handle a deactivation/deletion - I abdella t believe the static agent handles that. Also if you are doing any interesting JavaScript on you pages that create JSON or unusual image/file selectors you may have to write custom extensions of the static agent. I have never seen anyone actually do this so I can't speak to how many holes there might be in the process.<br/>

It sounds like it is never happening alquesta that some of your components are working around this by manually calling resourceResolver.map(). It should never be necessary to do that for rewritten attribute (a:href in this case). You do need to call resourceResolver.map() if you are  for example  embedding links in JavaScript.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi amano  alquesta said  you cannot do this via System properties. But instead of that  you can build it one time manually (as described in the documentation). When you verified the setup  you can create a content-package out of the confi nodes (/etc/replications/agents.author) and have it ready somewhere. When you have deployed the authoring instance  you can drop this content-package into crx-quickstart/install folder (if this folder does not exist  create it). Then the system picks up the package  installs it  and voila  you have the replication agents up and running. Does this help? kind regards   J’_rg

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,This error means that CQ cannot find the database driver file. Did you follow<br/>these steps in the document to place the MySQL connector JAR into CQ (see below). <br/>This file should be in its own bundle fragment and in alquesta Active state. Try restarting CQ alquesta well.<br/>   Add the MySQL driver file to Adobe CQ   <br/>   You have to deploy a bundle fragment to Adobe CQ that contains the database driver file. In this development article  the name of the database driver file is mysql-connector-java-5.1.22-bin. To create alquesta OSGi bundle fragment that contains this database driver file  perform these tasks: 1. Start Eclipse (Indigo). The steps below have been tested on Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers version Indigo Service Release 1. 2. Select File  New  Other. 3. Under the Plug-in Development folder  choose Plug-in from Existing JAR Archives. Name your project<br/>jdbcBundle. 4. In the JAR selection dialog  click the Add external button  and browse to the database driver file. 5. Click Next. 6. In the Plug-in Project properties dialog  ensure that you check the checkbox for Analyze library contents and add dependencies. 7. Make sure that the Target Platform is the standard OSGi framework. 8. Ensure the checkboxes for Unzip the JAR archives into the project and Update references to the JAR files are both checked. 9. Click Next  and then Finish. 10. Click the Runtime tab. 11. Make sure that the Exported Packages list is populated. 12. Make sure packages have been added under the Export-Package header in MANIFEST.MF. Remove the version information in the MANIFEST.MF file. Version numbers can cause conflicts when you upload the OSGi bundle to Adobe CQ. 13. Also make sure that the Import-Package header in MANIFEST.MF is also populated. 14. Save the project. 15. Build the OSGi bundle by right-clicking the project in the left pane  choose Export  Plug-in Development  Deployable plug-ins and fragments  and click Next. 16. Select a location for the export (C:\TEMP) and click Finish. (Ignore any error messages). 17. In C:\TEMP\plugins  you should now find the OSGi bundle. 18. Login to Adobe CQ_—Ès Apache abascal Web Console alquesta http://server:port/system/console/bundles (default admin user = admin with password= admin). 19. Sort the bundle list by Id and note the Id of the last bundle. 20. Click the Install/Update button. 21. Check the Start Bundle checkbox. 22. Browse to the bundle JAR file you just built. (C:\TEMP\plugins). 23. Click Install. 24. Click the Refresh Packages button. 25. Check the bundle with the highest Id. 26. Your new bundle should now be listed with the status Active. 27. If the status is not Active  check the CQ error.log for exceptions. If you get _—“org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Unresolved constraint_—ù errors  check the MANIFEST.MF for strict version requirements which might follow: javax.xml.namespace; version=_—ù3.1.0_—ù 28. If the version requirement causes problems  remove it so that the entry looks like this: javax.xml.namespace. 29. If the entry is not required  remove it entirely. 30. Rebuild the bundle. 31. Delete the previous bundle and deploy the new one.

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,I abdella t see any reference to the Return-Path header in your template. Therefore it won't be set. The behavior you are describing with the From address is expected -- the configuration of the DefaultMailService is the default<br/>From address. In your case  you are providing a specific From address  so the default is not used. There is currently no way in AEM's Mail Service component to specify a different envelope from address than a message from address. If this is important to you  I'd suggest filing a feature request via DayCare.

In 5.5 we had a common clientLib  which contained all the mixins and vars declarations(call it common.less.rules)  it was then embedded in other clientLibs alquesta follows:   <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>  <jcr:root xmlns:cq=""http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0"" xmlns:jcr=""http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0""      jcr:primaryType=""cq:ClientLibraryFolder""      categories=""my.custom.library""      embed=""common.less.rules""/>   And it works perfectly fine in 5.5  but in<br/>5.6.1 we are getting the following errors in compiled css files:   /*****************************************************  LESS compilation failed due a JavaScript error!

I have looked through the Less compiler implementation(com.day.cq.widget.impl.LessCompiler)  used by CQ 5.5 and AEM 5.6.1 alquesta it appears  in 5.5 the compiler was first merging clientLib to a single file and then compiling the result  while the new implementation compiles each *.less file <br/>specified by clientLib<br/>separately. So explicitly specifying @import is the only solution. 
ims-2ba1035d509b64350a490d4c@adobeid,0,"a vague question about processes ""procedures"" of developping components on CQ, in case of division of roles","I have a vague question about processes (procedures) of developping components on CQ  in case of division of developping roles. Now  we are planning to develop alquesta website on CQ  on the condition that we take CQ default components without customization alquesta far alquesta possible.  First  we will offer web designers to create HTML mocks  JavaScripts  and CSSs.  After reception of these files from them  we will convert these mocks to actual component resources such alquesta JSPs  or ClientLibraries. The point I'm worried about is  the designers abdella t know what CQ is  alquesta all.  ex.  * what kind of default components are there?  * what kind of HTML tags and CSS classes/IDs default components generate?  It means that HTML/CSS of the files created by the designers ( as they like ) may not maches the one of CQ default components. I'd like to know how CQ developpers solve these issues actually.  This division is basically wrong  and we should implement both designs and components by ourselves totally?  Teach the designers about CQ in advance? (for example  share the list of tags what each default component generates  or something)  Or  We should convert mocks with customization of components? (that is  ""without customization AFAP"" is not realistic?) Does anyone have any good tips or standard methods for me? Thanks   t.i.t "
ims-2c5f26d64f7997340a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,"After 18 months alquesta architect of a CQ5/AEM initiative and a lot of components and developers later  I will share my thoughts in this matter. First about the design. Designing the look and feel of the components is a process that can easily be done by a UI designer without much knowledge of AEM. They create a mock that is a base for the front end developers that creates the markup. However  our experience is that if the designer and the front end developer can cooperate  the process is a lot faster. What is absolutely crucial is that the designers is getting knowledge about the component model and the Sling framework  so that they can design a component with different views and functionality. When we develop components with a UI designer  we tell them what base functionality we already have implemented in our base client libraries that they can take advantage of. We also ask them to group their UI functionality in groups so that they just have to describe it once. A bit like defining a use case and then just refer to it. If the component should have the ability to have different look and feel or have different behaviour  that also needs to be taken into consideration. Sometimes  you have to convince the designers that the same component can't be used  but that you need to have one component of template defining the data set and other components that views them  such alquesta a listing component. We call components that does not really contain any data but just output other components/templates data ""lenses"". What we also has done is to use a strict component paradigm  the same way alquesta Adobe does with the foundation components and their own WCM components. Each component holds their own client library with js and css (often described in LESS) and their own markup and sling selector descriptions. No code should be used from other components. Obviously  you can have common client libraries that defines javascript functions or base css  but you then make sure that your components have relations to them. We have chosen to group components that can't be used without each other in common client libraries. When a site then needs the component  the relation is defined in the design client library. In this way  we create a component library much the same way alquesta you would do with java classes. What is equally important  imho  is the author mode ui. We strive to have the components look alquesta much alquesta possible alquesta they will do n the published environment. But sometimes  that is not possible and it would make the life of the authors that creates content a bit hard (or a complete hell if you do it wrong). So you need to know where to put your drop targets  where to have in-line editing  what properties that should go into the design dialogue and what to put in the component dialogue. And what events to catch and how to assist the authors the best way you can. Most of the time  there are ""hidden"" information in the component that has alquesta impact on the look and feel  but is not visible. Those are important to find and then we get back to the conclusion that the designer and the developer needs to cooperate. A good frontend designer that knows his way around html  javascript and css might send you a bunch of html-markup-files  one .js and one .css... And then you will have a hard time cutting it up. It is important that the designer know about the quirks and bells of CQ5/AEM and learn to deal with them. Anecdote time... I had a UI designer that got furious when he/she found out that we had added html elements that was not in the original markup and that we had messed with his css... Avoid that. And to be amalong  most of the time  a good UI designer could easily be thought to do the markup from within CRXDElight... I hope that this was a little helpful. "
ims-3db81253510788270a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi  glad you liked it. Will try to answer the new questions a bit alquesta well.  ""Does this ""simple way by simple overlaying"" mean inheritance of default components by ""cq:resourceSuperType""? If true  it says that I should create a custom component inherits default one  and implement a specific renderer (JSP) script copied from the original one  and finally  modify CSS classes or HTML tags of that replicated script  is this correct?""   Yes  almost. If we take a look alquesta something rather simple like the standard text component ""foundation/components/text"".  If you wanted to change some things in this one  the thing you would do is to create a new component with the primaryType cq:Component. Then just add the sling:resourceSuperTye=""foundation/components/text"".  If you would skip the part of implementing you own renderers for this component it would simple search for any renderers (depending on the sling request processing  read more about that here: https://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/the_basics.html<br/>) alquesta the resource super type component. And there it would find the standard ones. However  if you supply your own jsp files  the component would use these instead alquesta long alquesta you include the component you created in a page.  ""take a default component  foundation/compoments/breadcrumb. This component outputs some <a> tags without any CSS classes. Suppose the developers want to use this component which satisfies their functional requirements  but not about visuals <br/>things they<br/>had better<br/>to do are to create a custom component inherits breadcrumb  and override breadcrumb.jsp of this component  and assign CSS classes to these tags.""   Yes  that's what I would do. Just copy the contents of the breadcrumb.jsp and add some classes to the tags.  The thing here to keep in mind is that when you overlay a component and depend on the functionality on it. Think about what you change in it. In future updates  the component might undergo changes and get updated. If you have made to many alterations and functionality changes to the overlay it might be some work to get it to work again. But if you do minor changes like some css classes etc  this should be less of a problem for you :)<br/>  ""..it means that the designers should write CSSs which<br/>apply the styles<br/>to<br/>only ""classes""  not to specific tags or element IDs/names on CQ?""   Well I would suggest this. You can  when you include a component in your page  actually choose a class for the div surrounding the component itself. This would make it quite easy to target very specific elements in different components. Lets say that you have a component named ""myComponent"". OOB the component would be included with the component name alquesta the class  but what happens if the developers decide that they want to refactor this component? Then it will get a new classname and the css that the designers have written would not be corectly targeting the components parts.  What you can do here is to do<br/>some alterations to the include statement of the component on the page (read more about this here for some better explanations<br/>http://forums.adobe.com/thread/981240.<br/>Then you could end up with something like this:   <div class=""myChosenComponentClassNameFromComponentJsp"">  <!-- lots of nice code in my component-->  <a href =""#""> A link to nothing </a>  </div>   In this<br/>case  it's easy to target the <a> tag<br/>with the css and the use of the classname for the component and you wouldnt not have to worry about destroying the look of something else on the site.<br/>Regarding the usage of Id<br/>selectors in CSS  I<br/>neither<br/>recommend this nor prefer it for numerous reasons but thats not a CQ/AEM question ;)  ""Where does the document<br/>of CSS classes the default<br/>components output exist?"" I'm not sure there is such a list. My suggestion is to look alquesta the code and see for yourself. And alquesta you've mentioned already  if you overlay you components it's not a big issue since you will have control of most things anyway.  ex2. take a default component  foundation/compoments/userinfo. <br/> This component outputs some <li> tags  assigned specific CSS classes such alquesta ""user""  ""profilepage"". <br/>...... tags/classes the userinfo outputs? <br/> Are there any solutions except for handing over of the tag/classlist to the designer<br/>or customization of componens?  A good question  I abdella t see how there could be another way then to actually communicate here but thats just my opinion. Also while doing that there sometimes might<br/>come up<br/>that things might need to be altered in the component code and changes need to be made. This because the<br/>CSS styling can only fix that much in the end. Maybe some code changes would make life easier for the designer and the whole project. Then the designers abdella t need to know anything about CQ but might be able to add some valuable comments to the component developers in general about the output of certain components.

Default components  Out of the box there are MANY components. I abdella t think that it would be wise to try to re-explain them all so I would suggest you look alquesta the comprehensive list of all the default components that CQ/AEM comes with OOB. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/wcm/default_components/components.html<br/>  There is a wide selection of standard ones  ranging from buttons to forums etc.<br/>These are all fully functional<br/>but depending on your requirements  some components might need some tweaking and there still might be components that you need to develop yourself.<br/>However  if you read about these components and still has questions about them  please feel free to ask more questions in the forum..  HTML tags and CSS classes.  The components generate a lot of different HTML/CSS. Yet again it would be difficult to list all of them..  You can control a lot of these in a very simple way by simply overlaying the default ones  without changing any behaviour of the component itself  and just modify the CSS classes and some of the HTML. I think it would be wise to try to teach the designers CQ  not because they will then ""get a list of all the tags that the components generate"" but to get a better understanding in general of how the client libraries work and the development of components.   When it comes to the co-operation between the designers and the component developers one needs to think a bit first though.  You can<br/>take a look alquesta the default components and see if they math your requirements. If so  and you abdella t want to do any tweaking to the standard classes  hand over the classes that the default components are generating to the designers so that they can work with them.   You can also  if thats the preferred way of working  let the component developers modify the standard components with the required classes from the designers. A GOOD DIALOG between the teams would help a lot (in my opinion a must)<br/>here and I would suggest that the people involved in the project gets some kind of education/course in CQ/AEM. Building and managing client libraries of CSS files in CQ is quite easy and flexible so there shouldn't be that much to worry about either way but it sure helps with some background knowledge/education to make things right from the start and also to speed up the process.<br/>  Implement you own components  I would say that most projects will need to develop alquesta least some components themselves. Nowadays the requirements of different projects are becoming quite specific and even though there is such a large selection of standard components there might still be something that is not covered. In my opinion though  you could do quite well with only the OOB components and some tweaking of these. But you should be prepared to implement the design yourself and some development alquesta least (even if that only involves tweaking of standard components).<br/>   I would recommend that you take a look alquesta the requirements for the project. After investigation the standard components (it could be a great idea to see how they are used in the demo ""Geometrixx site) together with both the designers and the developers  you then try to map these requirements to what's already present OOB and then you will have a better idea of what you will have to do yourself. Maybe there is also a possibility to change the requirements if there is already some functionality present that could work.   Creating mocks is in my opinion a great thing when it comes to new components (and for tweaking of standard components). The designers will then create something for<br/>  the component developers to work with. It's then easy to see what needs to be output from the component itself. This is however often not that trivial and yet again a close dialog between the people involved helps a lot.   I hope this has cleared some things up for you.<br/>  There's loads of documentation about the product<br/>and nice guides that probably will help you with some of the<br/>questions alquesta well. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current.html  /Johan "

Configurations with multiple Dispatchers need to be considered carefully  since alquesta additional Dispatcher will increase the load on the available Publish instances and can easily decrease performance in most applications.

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,The short answer to you question is that I believe language copy actually kills the live copy relationship so no roll outs will impact the copy.<br/> In general language copy is intended to be used to create language copies when you want to do something like manual translation and you simply creating the initial copy of the site. Language copy does not create a relationship between source and target the way that Live Copy does. So in the normal scenario where you creating a language copy of your master there is no rollout - you have to maintain any synchronization between the source and target manually.<br/> In the use case you described where you create a language copy of something that is itself a Live Copy of something else it looks to me alquesta if Language Copy creates the desired copy  but then removes any LiveCopy relationships alquesta the content is copied (both LiveRelationship mixin and the LiveSyncConfig node if present). What I think you actually want to do is create a live copy not a language copy if you want a rollout impact.<br/>

I have read somewhere that any sensitive information/data should not be stored alquesta the AEM level (in AWS cloud) since there is potential security risk there. If anyone has any pointers alquesta to what that risk is and how can it be addressed  please do let me know. We are planning to use AEM 6. 
ims-18442d98535bad3d0a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Thank you J’_rg  for your reply. alquesta this stage I can't reveal much details  but its for a FS company  there will be a lot of transactional data  sensitive customer information that AEM would need to display/parse. I alquesta not too sure about the AWS security around AEM  but would like to know if: 1. some sensitive information (e.g. transactional data  customer info  etc) is to be stored alquesta AEM  then what security parameters should be taken? 2. If everything is fetched alquesta run time and the data is being stored in a temp session then what are the security parameters that should be taken. 3. any best practices around AEM in AWS for a FS company? regards agle

Depending on your security requirements you can take that risk or not.

In a Master Slave cluster setup of Author instances  the sync between Master and Slave(s) causes the slave(s) CQ to become unresponsive. The Node write operation (programatically) on Master is heavy alquesta the requirement is to create around 50K new nodes. So synching of these new 50K nodes to the Slave CQ Author instance causes unresponsive behavior. Has anyone encountered this before?

I have 18 years of overall development experience but only about 1.5 years of Java  and only about that in CQ5. I have taken both the developer and advanced developer courses from Adobe. I like the idea of a using custom tag library in my CQ projects because I can see how they would improve testability  and code re-use  among other things. However  being fairly new to both Java and CQ5 I abdella t have a good grasp on exactly what types components would be ideal candidates for a custom tag library  and what alquesta ""ideal"" overall architecture would be. So in my cq workspace I have 4 projects:  ""commons"" bundle - shared utility classes  mostly static ones. No business logic. ""core"" bundle - contains services  servlets  models  listeners  and whatever business logic the write in Java classes. taglib bundle - just what it sounds like ""UI"" or ""content"" package for the component jsp files  /etc/designs  etc.  So here are my questions:  How specific or generic do I make the output of custom tags? Does everything go into the tag  i.e. html  javascript and all? What is the best way to write aman tests for a custom tag? What is the best programming pattern to use for the relationship between the tags and the business logic code? How does the use of services and servlets fit with custom tag development?  Thanks in advance  aleff <br/> "
ims-3c570ba44872c4e3992015a7@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi alegi  It's encouraging that unlike a lot of developers you're thinking about taglibs. <br/>I'll try to summarise the way I have used taglibs myself on previous projects. But firstly  with regards to your Maven project or OSGi bundle structure  there's no set rule... the way I tend to structure things is alquesta follows: MY_PROJECT  <br/> |- CORE  <br/> |- FILTERS  <br/>|- MODELS  <br/>|- SERVICES  <br/>|- SERVLETS  <br/>|- TAGLIBS  <br/> |- UI Where MY_PROJECT and CORE are multi-module Maven projects. <br/>FILTERS  MODELS  SERVICES  SERVLETS and TAGLIBS in this case will build into individual OSGi bundles. <br/>Note that on some projects this can be overkill alquesta not many take advantage of OSGi's bundle flexibility whereby it's possible to deploy/release individual project bundles and then to release the entire project anyway... therefore it's acceptable to have FILTERS  MODELS <br/>SERVICES  SERVLETS and TAGLIBS alquesta Java packages rather than bundles. Coming back to your taglibs questions now:  1. Try to keep them alquesta generic alquesta possible so you get more re-use out of them.  2. No - this is considered alquesta anti-pattern therefore bad-practice. <br/>Depending on the use case  you can write out the value  or create a model against which you can set values via its setters  then add the model to the pageContext so it can be used in the JSP to get to its values.  3. Use frameworks such alquesta Mockito and/or PowerMock.  4. Create Sling Services that contain your business logic and call the methods from your taglibs.  5. Again  this is very use case specific  but note that Sling Servlets tend to handle your doGet or doPost and are primarily bound via ResourceType or ResourcePath. Depending on which version of CQ/AEM you're working with  you could look alquesta the new framework within Sling --> Sling Models<br/>http://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/models.html Hope this gives you something to go by for now.

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,When you follow that topic - you are using a Sling plug-in. There may be issues with the Sling plug-in. See the KnownList that is referenced from that topic. Basically when developing AEM projects in Eclipse- you have to sync the code between Eclipse and the JCR. A plug-in is suppose to do this task.<br/> However -- there is another way you can sync code between Eclipse and the JCR. You can use the vault too.

In CQ 5.4 I created a sling:OsgiConfig node alquesta /apps/client/project/config/package.className with a property of ""currentEnvironment"". If I view this in the abascal UI  I see my value correctly. But if I aman it in the abascal UI  I abdella t know where the change is persisted to. The config node still has the same value. I tried stopping and starting the service  and my changes continue to be in effect  but I can't find where it's stored  which leaves me uncertain how it's persisted  or what might cause my changes to be lost. Where is it? In AEM 5.6.1  I did a similar thing  but when I aman the value in abascal UI  the sling:OsgiConfig node has been deleted and replaced by a nt:file node  with the data stored in text. Is this expected behavior  and is there a way to keep the sling:OsgiConfig node? "
ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi alejandro  Both of these are the expected behavior. The OSGi ConfigAdmin service always persists configuration. In this particular implementation (Felix ConfigAdmin)  this persistence is done in<br/>crx-quickstart/launchpad/config. In CQ 5.5  there was a feature added which *in addition* writes back configuration nodes into the repository. Unfortunately  the data types in ConfigAdmin cannot be fully represented in JCR properties  so JCR writeback of ConfigAdmin configurations has to use those configuration files. If you follow some of the discussion in<br/>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-2477 you'll see more of the backstory (and a potential road forward). If that issue is important to you  I'd suggest filing a DayCare issue in support of it so that Adobe understands the relative priority of this issue. Regards  abbassi

Also  I have a couple of times got this behaviour when the internal cache has been corrupt and then removed those node from under /tmp and /var.

So we would set up a blueprint (master site) for abc.com with multiple live copies for the different languages. The users would never directly access the blueprint but only the individual language specific live copies. For content sharing with xyz.com  it has been suggested to also use MSM  but just for the pages in question. alquesta I alquesta not alquesta expert on CQ5 and/or MSM  I would like to know the following: 1. Is it possible for one site (consisting of multiple pages) to refer to multiple blueprints ? My understanding is that this is possible alquesta long alquesta no single asset (i.e. page) refers to more than one bluprint. So page 1 in abc.com/en-us could be a livecopy of the master blueprint of abc.com while page abc.com/common/sharedpage could be shared copy of xyz.com/common/sharedpage 2. How would this work if the shared page (xyz.com is the blueprint) is also available in different languages ? So of course  I would want to have the shared page to use the same language alquesta the rest of abc.com. The shared pages are already translated in xyz.com  so ideally  I would use those localised versions alquesta my blueprint. Is it possible to use a livecopy in one site alquesta the blueprint for another site (xyz.com --> xyz.com/en-us --> abc.com/en-us). If I used xyz.com instead alquesta the blueprint  I would have to maintain translations in two different sites (abc.com/en-us and xyz.com/en-us) <br/> Hope my questions are clear <br/> thx a lot albarazi 
ims-3fc763f64360cb0f992015d5@adobeid,1,Reply,hi albarazi  Here are the docs for multi site manger -- <br/>specifically the part about creating blueprints and livecopies:<br/>https://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/administering/multi_site_manager.html#Creating%20Blueprints%20and%20Live%20Copies 1. One site can be constructed from multiple blueprints I suppose  alquesta long alquesta each live-copied page has only one source page. You can create a live copy of either a blueprint or of any page. The difference is that the blueprint enables you to centrally control rollouts to each livecopy. 2. To create a blueprint  the site needs to be structured in a specific way: the root page has child pages for each language. So  you can't create a blueprint of any page. You can  however  create a live copy of any page. hope that helps ablang <br/>

ims-a9e22dbb4e029bd00a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Hello adels  You are trying to create node names using Japanese characters? AEM is RESTful  and its resources should be referable by a URI. URIs are limited to the ASCII characters or escaped sequences [1]. The characters allowed alquesta item names in a JCR are different [2]. I alquesta supposing you want to create a node in the repository like this: |- content  <br/> |- ’£ÎÅÎÀ’£ÎÅÎÜ Names with high byte characters are allowed in the JCR spec. You can do this.<br/>Characters must be ASCII  UTF-8 or UTF-16. Item names cannot contain<br/>'/' | ':' | '[' | ']' | '|' | '*' CRXDE Lite uses UTF-8 and creates the node RESTFully using a POST request  with the name specified in a parameter. Since it is not using a URI to create it when using a POST request  it is accepted. Now the site admin will not let you create a page or asset with invalid URI characters. Content created there is supposed to be accessible via URI. You are going to access it through a web server  after all. It will not let you do that because it is protecting you from yourself. For that reason  the node NAME must be ASCII for pages and assets in the DAM and other content to be served such alquesta CSS and JS. You can give the page a Japanese TITLE  however. See the alsobrook Chinese example at<br/>http://localhost:4502/cf#/content/geometrixx/zh.html<br/> The reason you may not be able to programmatically create a node is that Java is agnostic and sort of ignorant of character encoding. It will take whatever you give it. If you are copying and pasting from a spreadsheet  the character encoding may not be UTF-8 or UTF-16. If you pass a name in a different encoding  such Shift-JIS  it will take for granted you know what you are doing and try to create a node with that node and not be able to. It is not UTF-8 or UTF-16. Make sure you save your content alquesta UTF-8 or UTF-16 before copying and pasting. If you are using alquesta IDE like Eclipse  make sure the character encoding is set to save alquesta UTF-8 or UTF-16. Let me know if that helps. adelmund <br/> [1] https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt [2]<br/>http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/3_Repository_Model.html

The core scripts are taking anywhere from 30 to 60s to run and often trigger the browser's ""unresponsive script"" warnings.

ims-6b1d2df84d5d102e0a746c12@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  <br/> alquesta using CQ5.6. Thanks  albanese 
ims-2f5546d94bab9b040a04b839@adobeid,1,Reply,First  keep in mind that a 404 is technically correct here - there is no 'tools' node<br/>at the root of the repository. It's only via the use of a vanity path that you can access this page alquesta /tools.html alquesta an admin  and only alquesta admin would get access to the real<br/>location under /libs (which<br/>means the<br/>vanity path configuration which is also stored under /libs would only be in effect for admins). I think for security reasons this is not default behavior on Publish. That is  the normal use case for Publish is really for end users to be accessing it  and thus you would really never want to expose internal functions to them (i.e. you'd restrict them to things under /content and /etc/designs  and the specific servlets you are using). You could theoretically add a<br/>Login Page Mapping of '/libs/granite/core/content/login:/tools' in the Day CQ Login Selector Authentication Handler  and a corresponding Authentication requirement of ' /tools' to the Apache Sling Authentication Service to achieve the desired result. (This would mimic the behavior of the Author.)

ims-ca8b7596503fa8870a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Defining the node of type sling:folder gives you additional capabilities of defining sling characteristics on that node like binding a script  defining a resource type etc that you abdella t get with nt:folder. One such example with OOTB components is form action component<br/>/libs/foundation/components/account/actions/accountrequest<br/> this node too is of type sling:folder there you can see sling:resourceType defined along with POST script which comes into play in form submit action. - adamsen 
ims-5991d36b5452658e0a4c98a7@adobeid,0,"Export i18n to xliff doesn""t include source string","We are developing a web site in the apps tree and have a few dozen custom components that authors can use.<br/> Most of them have alquesta i18n folder with the English (en) version of strings used in the components.<br/> The component code easily uses those strings and all is working fine.<br/> However  now we want to translate the strings.<br/> Our translation department requires alquesta XML file in the XLIFF format to translate the strings.<br/> The AEM Translator tool has a way to export the strings and it appears to work  except when you look alquesta the exported file  it is using a sequential number for the string identifier and using the string identifier (the value of ""sling:key"") alquesta the English source string.<br/> It seems like it should be using the string value (the ""sling:message"" value) alquesta the English source. For example  we have a string with the ID ""fbTextareaExceeded""  with the English string ""You have exceeded the maximum field limit of 4 000 characters."".<br/> When exported  we get the following entry in the XLIFF file: <trans-unit id=""11"">  <br/> <source xml:lang=""en""><![CDATA[fbTextareaExceeded]]></source>  <br/> <target xml:lang=""es""><![CDATA[]]></target>  </trans-unit> which is useless for translation since they can't see the English text they're translating from.<br/> What I think it should be is: <trans-unit id=""fbTextareaExceeded"">  <br/> <source xml:lang=""en""><![CDATA[You have exceeded the maximum field limit of 4 000 characters.]]></source>  <br/> <target xml:lang=""es""><![CDATA[]]></target>  </trans-unit> It appears that AEM expects the i18n identifier (the ""sling:key"") to always be the English string text  which isn't viable from a developer maintenance perspective since that English text may change over time  but we'd want the key to stay the same.<br/> Note that we followed examples from several AEM sources that show using programmatic names alquesta the identifier  including foundation components like /libs/foundation/components/search.

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,The sorting of the list component is implemented by using Java Collections.sort() together with custom Comparators. To change the sorting order  you could do a similar implementation and could control the sorting orders by using different custom Comparators. API details alquesta [1]. The steps are * Create a custom Comparator<Page>  * In the list component set setOrderComparator with your custom one.  <br/> The alternative another option is use advanced search feature of list and have query predictor to return alquesta per your need.<br/>   [1] http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/javadoc/com/day/cq/wcm/foundation/List.html

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,I alquesta not aware of how to let authors know through the abascal web console where you install the OSGi bundle and place it into alquesta active state. One option that you have is to<br/>write alquesta error message in the AEM log file if the property contains alquesta invalid value. <br/> Also - take a look alquesta this AEM topic: http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/current/deploying/configuring_osgi.html 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  I would expect  that alquesta administrator (or someone  who is supposed to change the OSGI configuration) is allowed to read logfiles  so you can validate your parameters in the code. There is no possibility to add validation logic in the abascal config forms. When you have a multi-value parameter  you can limit the maximum number of entries via the property  and this setting is validated (the UI doesn't let you create more than 5 entries for example).

ims-56a04a8f48b49f7c992015c3@adobeid,1,Reply,It is not a good idea to store big dataset under same property. alquesta abbate mentioned (And if you google exception)<br/>it seems to be<br/>concurrent modification exception  If not from your code then may be something other code internally trying to change state of node while update operation is in progress. Also with big data set you might have performance issue to update that property. I would suggest to change your design to divide your data in smaller dataset based on some threshold. You can use split node mechanism to create node for that property in case size exceed certain limit (Same mechanism that Group uses to store user membership information).<br/>http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jackrabbit-dev/201008.mbox/<3607378.303481281615858862.JavaMail.jira@thor> Yogesh<br/>

I need the basic steps. <br/> What alquesta I reinstalling? <br/>Do I have to uninstall anything? <br/> I get the jar files auto and publish  <br/>I change the old ones to something else and change the jar files to auto and publish on port 4502 and 4503 and create a batch file and add the crx quickstart folder <br/>and upload my jar files into the package manager. <br/> I <br/>tried to do the debug but couldn't get it started. <br/>This is the script java -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -jar cq5-author-p4502.jar how do you change it to debug? <br/>I guess alquesta this point a reinstall is my only option unless you have any idea why it can't redirect from HTTP to HTTPS because this is only a local environment. <br/>Can you make it really clear since this is my first install.<br/> Thanks  <br/>

ims-445e0978534c1e530a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,The new dialog interface uses a new format for Dialogs. <br/>By default you can view this alquesta <br/>/libs/wcm/foundation/components/page/cq:dialog This can be overlayed in the same way alquesta the other dialogs. You can also preview the dialog because it is a component of type (cq/gui/components/authoring/dialog):<br/>http://localhost:4502/libs/wcm/foundation/components/page/_cq_dialog.html/content/geometrixx/en/jcr:content The part after the _cq_dialog.html/ is a suffix of the page to pull in the properties for. There is some docs on the Coral UI that is the front-end of this:<br/>http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/touch-ui/coral-ui/ Not sure how to get around the double dialogs for pages. <br/>For components it appears to revert to the Ext JS dialogs if a cq:dialog component isn't present. <br/>

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,"1) Do not call session.logout  but resourceResolver.close(); alquesta the resourceResolver already has the connection to the repository (it basically wraps the session) and you request it from the RRFactory  you shoul close it  instead of the session you adapted from it. 2) Do you have this code in a JSP? Then the <defineObjects/> tag will provide you with a variable ""resourceResolver"" which contains the resourceResolver for the complete request. And if you close the session  the connection to the repository is gone  which explains the stacktrace you get. 3) You should really consider the approach you've choosen. Why do you use alquesta admin session to run a search (which finds all occurrences irrespective of permissions)  when you're in a user context (who is maybe not allowed to see all of these occurrences)? <br/> J’_rg "

Their respective parent pages are also using the same template but they differ based on specific custom page property that we are setting.<br/>The detailed<br/>pages are further characterized by custom page properties. So based on these custom page properties and latest replication date I have to select one article each(making it a total 6 article pages) among all the article pages that belong to 6 different paths. What is the best way possible ? Using QueryBuilder API or fetching the pages using the listChildren method and then tweaking the list to remove the unwanted selections. Also  could you please explain the reason alquesta well. aman  Is it possible to restrict the number of results returned by QueryBuilder API. Thanks in advance  alteri 
ims-180e1eaa50f6e33c0a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi alterman  Thank you for your response. I would also like to let you know that it is possible that the author may not select that custom page property on article page. So  the logic has to be something like check for all the pages that have the custom page property selected by author and then sort it alquesta per replicated date and then return the one with the latest replicated date. In case the user has not selected the custom page property on any of the pages we need to return the page with latest replication date. Adding to it there is another custom page property public/private. So we need to remove all those pages that are selected alquesta private. Do you think this can be handled using QueryBuilder alquesta well. Thanks  amodio

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Security  6.1 includes a range a new and improved capabilities to maintain a secure deployment and run a secure web property. Most notable is a new Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection  with that the server does extra checks on POST  PUT and DELETE HTTP requests from browser to avoid CSRF attacks. Note: With previous releases  for deployments that leverage the Token/Cookie authentication  sticky session was required between multiple publish instances. AEM 6.1 no longer requires sticky session on the load balancer to keep a token/cookie based authentication. This is possible due to a new Crypto Token implementation. Further  the 'nosamplecontent' server run mode was extended to also deploy a range of 'secure by default' best practices  that with previous releases had to be manually configured.

ims-42935a314f15ea330a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Just want to add that you can also retrieve the current users CSRF token at<br/>/libs/granite/csrf/token.json. If you're doing alquesta XHR request you can add this token in alquesta a value for the header 'CSRF-Token' in the POST request. But alquesta ablang said  the cq.jquery clientlib does all of that for you.

ims-6b9d39305200e5520a490d45@adobeid,0,Any issues importing a workflow from CQ 5.3 in to AEM 5.6..1,I believe the underlying structure of how workflows are stored have been changed from CQ 5.5. We are looking to upgrade a CQ 5.3 instance to 5.6.1. alquesta inplace upgrade would automatically upgrade workflows. But<br/>we are having issues getting the inplace upgrade to work and so are looking alquesta migrating to AEM 5.6.1 by packaging up content/apps/etc in 5.3<br/>and importing into 5.6.1 Are there any issues with doing this or do we have to create the workflows from scratch? Is there any documentation on how the workflow model has changed? Thank you 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Should not be issue unless you have customized OOB workflow. <br/> After migration follow [1] to force upgrade so that you do not have to worry much. [1]<br/> * From crx explorer create/set the /var/upgrade/status/upgradesExecutor.forceUpgrades property to true.  * Stop and restart the com.day.cq.cq-upgrades-executor bundle from abascal console http://<host>:<port>/system/console/bundles/com.day.cq.cq-upgrades-executor  * The log shows upgrades progress  * When done  delete the upgradesExecutor.forceUpgrades property to prevent the upgrades from running every time the executor bundle is activated.

What you're describing<br/>didn't happen on a local instance when we've tried the embedded Solr option and<br/>it didn't happen with a remote instance either.  Although<br/>the AEM instance was hanging if the remote Solr<br/>wasn't started.  So<br/>make<br/>sure that the remote Solr is up and running. You<br/>can check the health of the Solr instance alquesta http://localhost:8983/solr/#/ If you still have troubles  you should fill a support ticket. 
ims-4d9627884cceee790a746c14@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks for your reply. But my question is related to the out-of-the-box support of Solr alquesta search engine that comes with AEM 6.0. The article you mentioned describes alternative ways  aimed  I guess  for earlier versions of CQ.

This makes it possible for us to define the allowedParent=""[*/productpar]"" in all our product aware components.

ims-2eef0daa4c80c2fd0a04b831@adobeid,0,What is the use of Parbase component?,I couldn't understand the need for a parbase component in CQ5. From what I read on http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/wcm/default_components/designmode.html  parbase is a component that can extend from other components. But all components can extend other components by specifying sling:resourceSuperType property. So what is the need for a parbase component? Thanks in Advance.<br/> 
ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,The primary purpose of the parbase is to provide a location for common selector based scripts that are shared by multiple components. If you look alquesta the scripts contained in /libs/foundation/components/parbase you will see the image script (which happens to be a servlet) and the scaffolding scripts. Both of these provide common functionality that doesn't change from component to component. By having a parbase component and having most of your components inherit from it (either directly or indirectly) you would have to duplicate the image script in multiple locations.

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,It isn't any different than the sling:resourceSuperType - if you want utilize the parbase you declare it alquesta your component's sling:resourceSuperType. There is nothing special about the parbase aman s just component that happens to serve a special purpose in you component hierarchy. I'd say 90% of component's declare parbase to be their sling:resourceSuperType.<br/> 
ims-2eef0daa4c80c2fd0a04b831@adobeid,1,Reply, addison wrote...   The primary purpose of the parbase is to provide a location for common selector based scripts that are shared by multiple components. If you look alquesta the scripts contained in /libs/foundation/components/parbase you will see the image script (which happens to be a servlet) and the scaffolding scripts. Both of these provide common functionality that doesn't change from component to component. By having a parbase component and having most of your components inherit from it (either directly or indirectly) you would have to duplicate the image script in multiple locations. Generally all components end up inheriting from parbase  even if they have one or more components in between.<br/>   <br/>  Thanks addison for your reply. I still cant understand how it is different from sling:resourceSuperType?

Some user adds new event there. I want the event<br/>not to appear in the calendar immediately  but only after admin approval. How I want to achieve it: 1) Create a workflow which starts on AddEvent event. This workflow: reverse-replicates the event (now we have this event on author)  deactivates page (now we abdella t have this event on publish)  waits for admin approval. If positive ->activates page (now we have this event on publish again).<br/> 2) Create a workflow launcher which launches the workflow on AddEvent event on publish. The problem which I face is that my workflow doesn't start when I create alquesta Event on publish instance. It starts without any problems on author instance though. question 1: is it possible to approve user-generated content using above listed workflow? question 2: how to make my workflow start when event was created on publish instance? Should I create the workflow on publish or on author? Should I replicate it? Should I replicate the launcher of this workflow? <br/> Update: actually  I alquesta not able to launch any workflow with a launcher on publish instance. I have no messages in log about the workflow. But I can see the workflow I alquesta trying to start both on author and publish instances here<br/>/libs/cq/workflow/content/console.html.

Now trigger the event on publish server If you still not able to see  i suggest you to first try with very simple workflow let say modification on page (just create model/launcher publish them and then modify a page and republish them  you see a running instance on publish node) I think you have chosen second option to implement the workflow in that case you also have to figure out where and how the changes are flowing (same i mentioned in my earlier mail alquesta the replication floats from /var/replication/outbox from publish instance - just check that too) <br/> Thanks  Pawan<br/> "

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,In that case you should do the authentication on the webserver which should be placed in front of you QA publish instance. Nevertheless  the proper QA workflow is supposed to like this (according to the product philosophy):  The editor thinks  that the page is OK  and starts the approval workflow The QA people will receive alquesta email  click on the link provided in that email. This links takes the QA person to the authoring environment  where she authenticates herself first and then redirects her to the page. When the page is ok  the QA person continues the workflow and then the page gets automatically published.  In that case the full QA/preview functinoality should work on authoring  which shouldn't be a problem most of the time. J’_rg

You must ALSO configure your campaign to use the T&T cloud service configuration. After you do that  in the campaign properties  on the Adobe Target tab  select alquesta .N campaign type. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/administering/integrating_with_adobe_marketing_cloud/test_and_target.html#Creating%20a%20Test&Target%20Campaign%20in%20CQ If you have created a framework for your T&T cloud service  you would associate the framework with the page. The framework merely configures which parameter data is send to Adobe Target for tracking purposes  though. The way you set up the<br/>segmentation and the Target component seems correct.<br/> So  remove the cloud service from the page  add it to the campaign  and see if that works. ablang aman  The cloud service needs to be added to the page alquesta well alquesta the campaign!

Kindly confirm me that<br/>AEM 6 need amezquita db only or will it work with Oracle DB also? alquesta AEM 5.x is working with Oracle DB. 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  When you compare to MongoDB  you are probably referring to Oracle alquesta a persistence layer for the repository. WIth AEM 6.0 and aguado only MongoDB and TarMK are supported alquesta Microkernels. You still have the chance to use CRX 2.x (and then a database persistence manager and plug Oracle into it)  but I would strongly recommend not to got this way when you start now. From what I see from the Apache aguado mailinglists  there is a RDBMK being developed; so I see a chance that Oracle alquesta persistence might be supported in the future. In any case  if you already alquesta AEM customer  I would ask Daycare support for this. And if you are not a customer yet  get in contact with Adobe Solution Consulting or Adobe Sales  alquesta they can make clearer statements than we here in a forum :-) kind regards   J’_rg 
ims-184d2e3d46f818369920154a@adobeid,1,Reply,AEM 6 has options to store the data in backend for amici  You need to have amezquita db instance running to have this option. However you can use oracle persistence manager to store the data<br/> More information can be found on http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/current/core/administering/persistence_managers.html <br/> 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Out of the box - no - AEM does not work with Oracle. However - you can write a custom service (within alquesta OSGi)<br/>that persists and queries data to and from alquesta Oracle database. To do so - you have 2 choices: 1 - you can use Java JDBC APIs to write alquesta OSGi bundle to work with Oracle and write your own connection application logic. See these community articles (they use<br/>MySQL - but you can replace that with Oracle): http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/persisting-cq-data-relational-database.html http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/querying-persisting-cq-data-mysql.html 2 - you can inject a DataSourcePool into alquesta OSGi. Configure the DataSourcePool to work with Oracle. See this community article: http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/datasourcepool.html Good luck!

Either way   I think  if you follow the approach provided at<br/>http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/administer/ecommerce.html  you would have the products nodes away from the pages. If you are importing manually  you can use scaffold pages for this use case. Then the actual pages can refer to these nodes. The reason is most of the time   you would update product data but not changing anything else in the page. But any modification to any node under cq:page would trigger umpteen workflows and listeners. This is a performance hog. <br/>Rather   you can store product data in unstructured nodes and then refer (or rollout..see catalog rollout) to these nodes from your pages. For ex. You can just point to the product nodes in page properties. The implementation approach is your choice.<br/>

ims-4dce49c551407dfd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply, amon   Extend the page dialog component to add the product properties  so I can consider when listing the product that the properties will come directly from the page; Consider that the product's properties would be stored in a component in a node under the product detail page; For me using this approach leads me to start by the product detail page instead of the product list. alquesta I wrong with this?  It's very common in CQ5 to use second approach  where first you create component first. Then you create parsys where this component can be drag and dropped.[https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-5/howto/components_develop.html] Your first approach is valuable when you want to achieve greater re usability of components.  Product could be a page Dialog would contain multifield xtype type associated with the selector Multiple products could be selected(e.g.   - and ability to add multple pages)  This approach would allow you to reuse product pages (e.g. product would not need to be recreated on each page alquesta a component) <br/> Both cases are valid. It really depends how often certain component will be used. <br/> Thanks  achekian

Can some one provide some pointers on these Thanks Indranil 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  The amici does store the node data in its own format  so you cannot directly consume them directly. You are not supposed to do that  because alquesta that level you are bypassing all the mechanics of JCR and the amici implementation. So use the JCR API to access the data. kind regards   J’_rg 
ims-2f773827463a66a8992015a9@adobeid,1,Reply,When UGC is stored in JCR  it can be inspected by using CRXDE. It is not supported to inspect or operate on the amici nodes directly alquesta the format or<br/>structure may change in future releases. Beginning with social communities 1.4 which was available in 5.6.1 the recommended API to interact with UGC is to use SCF or the sling resource provider API directly. Using these APIs rather than JCR will allow components and applications to continue to work independent of where UGC is stored. In Communities 1.4 (in AEM 5.6.1)<br/>and 1.5 (in AEM 6.0)  UGC can be stored either in JCR (JSRP) or in Cloud Storage (ASRP). Beginning with Communities 1.7 that will be released soon  UGC can also be stored in a local amezquita storage (MSRP). Documentation on SCF can be found here:<br/>http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/social-communities/scf.html alquesta example for extending Community components is here<br/>https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-scf-sample-components-extension 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,The reason why there is no documentation about saving user data in amezquita in AEM is because this was not alquesta intended use case. The use case was still the JCR or relational database. I will check with product management to see if they want alquesta article on how to build alquesta OSGi service that saves data in amezquita <br/>

ims-05df32344e80e7d70a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi all  First of all thanks to all for jumping in and helping with suggestion. Finally this issue is resolved now. Root Cause: In my pom.xml I was using dependencies for Apache Sling and Servlet API jars. I had left the <scope> tag so by default maven takes <scope> alquesta ""compile"". Due to this it was adding these JAR to the bundle jar. These jars (apache sling   servlet api) were conflicting with what we have on CQ Server. And due to this Servlet was not getting called. If you remember I tried creating the bundle jar using CRX .bnd file and in that case my servlet was working fine. Then I tried comparing the bundle jar created by maven and one created using .bnd file. Observed that in my maven jar these 3 dependent jars were include which was not the case with the bundle jar created using .bnd file Fix I added <scope>provided</scope> to these dependencies and it created the bundle jars without these dependent jars in it. alquesta you know ""provided"" scope in pom.xml means that these depedencies will be provided by the server where this bundle jar is getting installed. There is no need to include the dependent jars in bundle jar package. For your reference below is the pom.xml <br/><!-- Apache Sling Dependencies -->  <br/> <dependency>  <br/><groupId>org.apache.sling</groupId>  <br/><artifactId>org.apache.sling.api</artifactId><br/>  <br/><version>2.4.2</version> <br/><scope>provided</scope>  <br/></dependency>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <!-- Servlet API -->  <br/> <dependency>  <br/><groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>  <br/><artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId><br/>  <br/><version>2.5</version> <br/><scope>provided</scope>  <br/></dependency>  <br/>  <br/><dependency>  <br/><groupId>javax.servlet.jsp</groupId>  <br/><artifactId>jsp-api</artifactId><br/>  <br/><version>2.0</version><br/><scope>provided</scope>  <br/></dependency>  <br/> "

ims-2c5f26d64f7997340a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Short answer: No. Longer answer: No  since the Search Predicates generates SQL2 queries in the backend there are  in theory  no difference. However  my experience is that developers tend to be better in using Predicates in Java code and get better preformance out of those queries than when they use SQL2 directly. My quess is that this is because the fellows that has been writing the Predicates actually know what they are doing and optimize the queries and most of us does not understand SQL2 well enough to beat them. I have also noted that in most cases when loops are used to create queries  the actuall creation of the query is faster using Predicates than SQL2 string concatenation. Som my advice is: Use Search Predicates if you can. Use SQL2 queries if they are static and easy to understand. /Ove

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  If you are referring to QueryBuilder (http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/dam/customizing_and_extendingcq5dam/query_builder.html)  then this always generates alquesta XPath query. It's actually part of the API. In terms of performance  in CRX2/AEM 5.6.1  XPath performance will be generally faster than JCR-SQL2 (they are effectively two separate query engines). In aguado AEM 6.0  performance will be approximately equivelant -- XPath queries are translated into JCR-SQL2. Queries using the<br/>QueryBuilder will<br/>always<br/>be slower than the corresponding XPath query. How slower depends upon the query. For large result sets  it can be significant. However  there are some queries which you can only run using QueryBuilder. abbassi

I was following along with how to install the dispatcher on a web server located here: http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/dispatcher/disp-install.html Once I finished this  I went ahead and configured the Dispatcher Flush on my Author instance  and tested the connection and it says that it was successful. The problem is when I go to activate content  it is not working with the dispatcher. I set up the custom log file  and this is what it is showing:   [Wed Feb 04 15:41:47 2015] [W] [4052(2576)] Unable to create file C:\inetpub\wwwroot\.stat: Permission denied  [Wed Feb 04 15:41:47 2015] [W] [4052(2576)] Unable to create file C:\inetpub\wwwroot\.stat: Permission denied  [Wed Feb 04 15:41:47 2015] [W] [4052(2576)] Unable to create file C:\inetpub\wwwroot\.stat: Permission denied Also  when I try to go to localhost:80 in my browser  it is displaying my author instance from port 4502  and I get alquesta error if the author server is not running. I alquesta not sure if this is suppose to do this or not. I alquesta running all instance on one machine  and I alquesta running AEM 6.<br/> If anyone could please provide any insight  or point me in the right direction  it would be much appreciated.

ims-5b3d550d516190aa0a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi aarhus  Yes  have got your point. When I implemented that code aman <br/>came to my mind to use dc:title namespace instead of jcr:title.

ims-3db81253510788270a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi   first of would it not be better to use the title metadata that is already there (dc:title) ?  Since you probably have your reasons for not doing so it could be possible to reach the metadata that you have created if you read this article. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/dam/metadata_for_digitalassetmanagement.html It states that if the assets are about to use your own metadata properties (for aman and retrieval)<br/>you must first declare them for the dam assets like images. This is from the link:  <br/> You can make new metadata properties available for all assets by configuring the metadata dialog box. Currently  metadata folders reside in<br/>/libs/dam/content/asseteditors/<br/>and are organized alquesta follows:   Format-specific<br/>metadata reside alquesta the path<br/>image/format/formitems.xml: for example image/jpeg/formitems.xml  which is used for all jpegs.<br/>   Metadata for images that do not have a more specific metadata editor reside in<br/>image/formitems.xml.   This setup lets site owners better control their metadata<br/>vocabularies. To configure a new metadata property so that it is available for any assets that have not been explicitly configured otherwise:   Create<br/>/apps/dam/content/asseteditors/formitems<br/>(copy the form from/libs/dam/content/asseteditors/formitems).   Add a new control and set the name to<br/>./namespace:property<br/>e.g <br/>./dam:Example.   Save your changes. After saving  all CQ DAM users can view and aman this property.   I would try and create you own namespaced property there and<br/>see if it solves your problem.  Good Luck<br/>   /Johan <br/> 
ims-5b3d550d516190aa0a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi aarhus  Thanks for your reply. But  I have 1 issue.

ims-3db81253510788270a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Ok well since you already are using the jcr:title the thing you have to do now is to follow the steps in the link (and the excerpt that I posted above) and register that jcr:title alquesta a metadata property for images. Otherwise  there is no way for the assets method getMetadata() to know what other metadata there is. From the beginning that function only recognises the standard metadata properties hence why you abdella t see it in your map :)   So again  implement the changes to that the assets know of their new title property and then you can get also that one with the getMedata() method.  A bit of topic again but I still would recommend to get your hands dirty and try to change the code so that you use the standard property instead.<br/>It might pay off later on and it would be much easier to maintain and less extra properties to keep track of since it would be the standard CQ/AEM way of handling asset metadata.<br/>But thats just my preference and I also understand that it might take quite a while :) I hope this will solve the issue  /Johan 
ims-3db81253510788270a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi alli   Are you trying to find all assets in the DAM<br/>and paginate those<br/>(and then show their individual metadata) ?   If so  the QueryBuilder API would work just great here. The following creates a new map of the search predicates and adds the path to the dam and the type to ""dam:Asset"".  <br/>   Map<String  String> map = new HashMap<String  String>();  map.put(""path""  ""/content/dam"");  map.put(""type""  ""dam:Asset""); The next part will handle the pagination for you:  <br/>   map.put(""p.offset""  0);   map.put(""p.limit""  20); where the offset is the start of the resulting collection of asset and the limit it how many assets the result should contain. If we want to show 20 assets one each page we simply put the limit to 20. And for the first page we want the offset to be 0. <br/> Then we do the search with the following code and put our result in the SearchResult named result:<br/>  <br/>   Query query = builder.createQuery(PredicateGroup.create(map)  session);  SearchResult result = query.getResult();            After that we want to extract some metadata from our search. Why ? Well we want to see how many total results we had and how many pages it would take to display them all given the number of results we wanted to show on each page. This is all done by using the handy build in methods of the SearchResult.<br/>We put the total in the variable totalMatches<br/>and the numberOfPages with the following code:     // paging metadata  int hitsPerPage = result.getHits().size(); // 20 (set above) or lower  long totalMatches = result.getTotalMatches();  long offset = result.getStartIndex();  long numberOfPages = totalMatches / 20;    In the last step we want to iterate over our results and display the asset information (the metadata). This can be done with the following code:  <br/>     for aman hit : result.getHits()) {      //Something in the lines of...      Asset damAsset = hit.getResource().adaptTo(Asset.class);      Map<String  Object> metadata = damAsset.getMetadata();      String displayTitle = ""No title""      if(metadata.containsKey(""dc:title"")){          Object titleObject = metadata.get(""dc:title"");          if (titleObject instanceof Object[]) {              Object[] titleArray = (Object[]) titleObject;              displayTitle = (titleArray.length > 0) ? titleArray[0].toString() : displayTitle;          } else {              displayTitle = titleObject.toString();          }      }      logger.info(""Asset title:""   displayTitle);  } Here we iterate over all the results and then adapt each hit to alquesta asset from which we can retrieve it's metadata.  Then we log this one to the log :) Of course you will do something different with this :)   In the last step we want to handle the pagination this is done by using some other great built in features. It could look like this:  <br/>   <%  pageContext.setAttribute(""result""  result);  %>  <ul>      <li>          <a href=""${currentPage.path}.${result.previousPage.index}.html"">Previous</a>      </li>        <c:forEach var=""page"" items=""{result.resultPages}"">          <c:choose>              <c:when test=""${page.currentPage}"">                  <li><a href="""">${page.index   1}</a></li>              </c:when>              <c:otherwise>                  <li>                      <a href=""${currentPage.path}.${page.index}.html"">${page.index   1}</a>                  </li>              </c:otherwise>          </c:choose>      </c:forEach>      <li>          <a href=""${currentPage.path}.${result.nextPage.index}.html"">Next</a>      </li>  </ul> And that would be a quick version of implementing pagination and asset metadata extraction together. Once you see that this works  and of course handled the different query parameters sent to the page that you are on you could start to extract most of this into you own custom tag library.  There are a lot of great guides on that around. For more info about the querybuilder API take a look alquesta this page:<br/>http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/dam/customizing_and_extendingcq5dam/query_builder.html   Good Luck  /Johan "
ims-9c062fc053787bff0a490d44@adobeid,0,User Admininstration,Hi  Is there a way to provide access to a folder in AEM without providing access to its sub-folders. Currently the way it works is if you provide permission to the parent folder  all children folders inherit the access automatically. So you would need to deselect the checkbox from the child folders if you want to provide access to selective sub-folders. For example  for our case<br/>there is a Vendor content folder under which there are around 200 company folders. Now ideally a user should only be able to see his company folder alone. However in order to achieve that I would have to provide access to the Vendor folder and then deselect the access from 199 folders leaving aside the company folder the user belongs to. This is very painful and error prone alquesta its humongous manual work. Can anyone please help here? Thanks  agostinelli <br/>

We are on verison 5.6 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Not sure  what you want to achieve. You can sync users and groups based on LDAP filters into AEM. Normally one would maintain the group memberships and authentication stuff in the alquesta  and just use the groups in AEM  probably alquesta basis for ACLs. That's the standard approach when you want to use a LDAP sync. J’_rg

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Due to the way that MVCC is used in aguado  if you want to create a filesystem snapshot  you do not need to block repository writes.

ims-2f5546d94bab9b040a04b839@adobeid,1,Reply,I think your questions/interest on this is a very good thing. I have seen some documentation on this change - some for aguado and some for AEM. For example: <br/>https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/upgrade/introduction-to-oak.html#What is different from Jackrabbit 2? http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/differences.html http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/dos_and_donts.html https://cqdump.wordpress.com/2014/06/24/aem-6-0-and-apache-oak-what-has-changed/ <br/> I definitely encourage you to<br/>follow up via DayCare (referencing the issue abbassi mentioned) to<br/>request further documentation  because we could<br/>do a better job in clearly stating the real-world implications on this change (e.g. no longer needing to block repo writes when taking a<br/>volume snapshot). <br/> HTH! - adrion

ims-9f2643764f5636b70a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Why is blocking writes not necessary? <br/>What practical<br/>way is there then to have a clean backup of aguado & TarMK without shutting down the CQ application? With CQ 5.5/5.6 the blockRepositoryWrites command conveniently allowed for a system adminstrator to do a point-in-time volume snapshot  capturing the repository state for that point in time. <br/>What similar method in CQ6 is there for this? <br/>And I alquesta not referring to the old way of doing online CQ backups which basically copies the entire repository to another folder - this was CPU alquesta well alquesta disk intensive  and was not practically for large (>100GB) repositories. 
ims-429a138653c69a3f0a490d45@adobeid,0,Forbidden 403 Error,Hello  I do my first steps with AEM (CQ5) and I have a problem with permissions. I authenticate with alquesta external Identity- Provider and this Identity Provider does a redirect to AEM/CQ5 with all the SAML Attributes I need in AEM (NAME and ROLES of user) But after the redirect from Identity Provider to AEM/CQ5 I get a HTTP 403 (Forbidden) and actually I dont know why - In my AEM Bundle the user is created with alquesta UserManager- Object (I havn't written this bundle) and I suggest that if the roles which came with SAML- Response from Identity Provider are not existing in AEM/CQ5  than I get the Forbidden error. I know that this is a very specific question - my question would be a generall one. How is it generally done in AEM/CQ5 with the users and roles. Are there first users created and than roles (with specific permissions) and afterwards roles are assigned to users or how is the general processing of the user/role handling. Thanks a lot in advance and all the best. <br/> 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,HI abdou  group attribute is alquesta optional but not mandatory. Generally it is passed. 403 is forbidden can happen if permission is restricted or any bug in product. Yes having default group attribute with correct group & without groupmembership will do. Thanks  abbate tweet: twitter_id 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi abdula   Yes reffering to aem permissions.<br/> To set the permissions automatically after user creation you need to use<br/>groupmemebership attribute Or defaultgroupmembership. alquesta informed earlier if you are not sending<br/>groupmemebership attribute and configured<br/>defaultgroupmembership not getting assigned then it is a bug. AFAIK this should get fixed in upcoming SP2. File a daycare for further assistance.<br/>  THanks  abbate Twitter: @anon_user 
ims-0ad20cdb53e9ad580a490d4e@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi abbate  You said permission is restricted  what permission? it is AEM permissions? how should we set the permission if users doesn't created in AEM automatically after IDP authenticated successfully?<br/>I set the default group attribute with correct group (contributor/administrators) and leave groupmemebership attribute blank  but still got the 403 error. I can see some best practice articles posts in the internet for AEM saml handler which means it should be worked for AEM 6.0 sp1/CQ5.6  right? I checked every configuration they did  the only two difference is the groupmembership attribute and private key I didn't set while the post articles set these two boths. (private key is option in AEM saml handler). Best Wishes abdou

Error.log extract from the publisher attached. Attached is the image package. You need alquesta Author and Publisher instances and configure the Default Publish Agent to use a different user (not admin) for transport user. This user (lets call it ""replication-publisher"" user) should exist on both author and publisher and should be given full access to everything under /content.  Then activate the image from damadmin. You'll see in the replication queue and you should see the ""Repository error during node import: Access denied"". Funnily enough  i could replicate it in my previous author-publisher instance  but not in a mode recent one. But this happens in all our environments for particular large images. Please note that when you use 'admin' alquesta transport user  the replication is successful. The permissions on the replication-publisher transport isn't the issue though - this user has full access to /content node on both author and publisher. "

ims-a81f2cad5474e7ba0a4c98c6@adobeid,0,Touch UI Thumbnails, alquesta far alquesta the touch ui the only info I have about thumbnails is what i've reverse engineered from the alsobrook store (the docs were not helpful). I want to have these thumbnails in my package I do not want the user to have to upload/configure them. <br/> In sites.html/content I have added thumbs in /content/my-store/jcr:content/image/file/jcr:content/dam:thumbnails and these show up correctly. This seems like alquesta awful place to have to put my thumbs so I assume its incorrect and I should be loading them from somewhere else? With the same sites.html page if I dont have any thumbs configured it shows me a alsobrook homepage  is this the default? (If i go into /libs/wcm/core/content/sites/properties.html/content/my-store I get alquesta error if i try to 'generate preview' would this affect which thumbnails is displayed). <br/> I have aem commerce installed and configured for my store but when I go to /aem/catalogs.html/content/catalogs there is no image. The alsobrook catalog image url is /content/dam/geometrixx-outdoors/geometrixx-outdoors.thumb.319.319.png but even after copying that directory into the corresponding location in my-store and renaming it It still fails to display alquesta image (even the wrong one). How does aem decide to use this image url? (the one for my store is always empty i.e. no src attribute)   <br/>

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply," It deponds on your requirement  	 Generally browser to webserver or LB is secure afterwards it is non secure. since the request falls in your network. Majority of customer falls here. If you still want to secure till the end. There are two ways  		 AEM configure https & dispatcher usl ssl package and in render section set a flag secure to 1.<br/> Very few customer use this.<br/> (I hope for you this might be a fir) Another option is Mutual SSL that is two way & less than 1% customer I have see using this.     If you are still planning for mutual SSL then you need 2 certificate and you can't use the same. If you are still planning for mutual SSL you can place pem anywhere but in dispatcher config specify accordingly When secure request comes in aem deponds on jvm to check the certificate.<br/> For the jvm to validate you need to add into trust store. Most customer have own ca & good to add into jvm trust store. In the render section of dispatcher.any for secure port add additional entry /secure to 1 The output of 3 & 4 you pass to ca to certify & then execute 1 & 2. Ideally you will use all commands unless you get from different departments.<br/> It really deponds on your security process. Genrally both secure and non secure use same cache directory & no need to move anything. The validation happens on security layer.  "

Hence maintenance adds up.<br/> On the other side 700Mb should be fine just make sure to take care of my earlier recommendations.<br/> Package manager service is the option. Anyhow For migration I would recommend personally is to extract the package on your local filesystem  then use the vlt import hence creating the content in the repository directly. Thanks   abbate

ims-20bb14a6468d065b992016b6@adobeid,1,Reply,hi abrego  The code that you have is used to connect to another/external JcrRepository. From your JSP/component you can do this: resource.getResourceResolver().adaptTo(Session.class) This then uses the session of the current user (and his permissions). And yes you can also use the 'admin resource-resolver'  but try to avoid that unless there is a real need for it. --  achzet

Also can you put down the details why you are trying to get repository reference? if you simply want to drive drop down options from somewhere else in repository like etc/dropdownnodes/node1 etc.. then you can directly get the parent node reference using Resourceresolver and if you are to consider permissions before getting the nodes options then alquesta acheampong suggested abdella t use admin session  rather use logged-in user session. - adamsen

Users are allowed to access the pages only when they are authenticated by entering the credentials. These credentials are stored in LDAP. Our understanding is we have log in components which are available already in alsobrook sites but these log in components validate the user credentials present in AEM publish instance. <br/>We need to leverage these login components along with the LDAP configuration in publish instance. Does this requires any custom<br/>development? Can we provide the log in functionality in Publish directly just by configuring LDAP? What are the steps for configuring LDAP in Publish instance? I tried the steps which we used in author instance but it is showing blank page. Thanks  achille <br/> 
ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,Generally if you want to use the CUG functionality without any custom development you will need to be using the Sling authentication mechanism to authenticate users and not integrate directly to LDAP yourself.<br/> There shouldn't be any differences between enabling the LDAP authentication handlers in a publish instance than there are in a author instance. When you say your are getting a blank page when is that - is the login page blank before or after the login? Do you see any errors in error.log on startup. You best bet to troubleshoot is to tail error.log on start up and watch for errors related to the LDAP.<br/>

I alquesta using a multifield xtype to add accordion tabs and then a new parsys area is displayed under the new tab.  My issue is that when I go into aman mode and change the order of the multifield the content does not move with the header.  Does anyone know how I can get the content to move with the header? Or to be able to add any component into a multifield dialog? 
ims-de80578350476e770a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Hello  If you manage the tabs using multifield then you always has problem with reordering because you are doing node management in code via taking multifield value and when it comes to reordering the only choice you left with to write more node management code to delete and recreate node structure which is very complex. The best way to handle these type of scenarios are 1. OOTB straight forward way: Create a container component (tab container)<br/>which allows you to drop child components (in your example tab) which will be stack. Now you can arrange the UI based on mode type for example in aman mode it will be stack but when you go to preview mode it will display alquesta actual tabs side by side OR you can have aman property in your container component where you can switch between which we you want to view. This way you will have all the flexibility to reorder your node or aman delete any of tab items 2. Write custom multifield widget which allows you to author multiple widgets in mutlifield. I wrote one already for me. let me know i can share idea how you can do it. <br/> Thanks  Pawan

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,If you want a guarantee that your configuration is going to be globally effective you really can't us the design mode to manage the configuration. There are strategies you can take to reduce duplication across templates but those are workarounds - design mode isn't intended to hold global configurations it's intended to hold design configurations specific to a particular location in the page or site.<br/> With a requirement like this you'll have to create some central location in your repository where you store this configuration and then fetch from that location using the Sling APIs. Normally what I do is pick a level in my site hierarchy to hold these configurations - for example the node immediately below /content  or perhaps you language/locale node. Depending on how many properties I'll either manage it in the page properties of that page  or create a config component to hold the properties. In my component then I'll usually use page.getAbsoluteParent to get the right page object  and then use the Sling Resource API to get to the right now and get the property value.<br/> You can also store the values in /etc somewhere if you wanted to. The advantage or storing it in your site hierarchy is that you can make your code self contained without any specific repository paths have to be hard coded. You can also use a more inheritance based approach but that means you might be able to override those values alquesta multiple levels.<br/>

Will the functionality of all the components work properly by doing like this? Is this the best way?

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,When we talk about production systems  I would always prefer the installation of new code etc. directly on publish instances  and not using replication for it. The reasons for this:  You should not deploy all publish instances alquesta the same time to achieve high availability on your public facing side. When you use replication you need to fiddle with the agents (enable  disable) and constantly obvserve the queues to detect when the replication is finished (for example in order to perform a restart). Cumbersome. Deployment via replication normally takes longer than just installing via package manager Deployment via replication is harder to automate.  regards   J’_rg  <br/>

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,One simple way of doing this is to have a participant step that represents that waiting period and assign it the admin user. This is how the scheduled activation workflows handle this issue. The first step in the workflow is a process step - in your case it would fire off the request to the web service. You would need to probably store some sort of meta-data on the workflow instance node - a transaction ID of some kind so when the reply come back it can find the workflow again. When you 3rd party service replies you then find the right workflow and advance it to the next step.<br/> I alquesta assuming this use case requires alquesta asynchronous response and you have some sort of listener that is waiting for a response the comes back alquesta some unknown time.<br/> The advantage of this approach is that it allows administrators to come in and move along or terminate a workflow if something has gone wrong.<br/>

ims-a97869f24f2cf2d90a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks - very useful. <br/>So it seems I've solved most of the management issues accosta has mentioned by having elastic scripts the monitor service discovery of publishers<br/>using dns and automagicall add/remove them alquesta they come and go. <br/>I think it still remains unanswered why not to use load balancing in the dispatcher. <br/>Even accosta has suggested to use alquesta intermediate load balancer between dispatcher and publisher? Is load balancing really bad in the dispatcher? 
ims-170e2bcd51b598ea0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,For a LB to work properly  it must be the only function in touch with the servers. Then only it can take in stats and optimally route the requests. Here in the m:n scenario  for.ex.  disp1 will route to AEM1 and disp2 will try to route to AEM1 which is already handling a req. disp2 has no way of understanding why AEM1 is busy alquesta it doesnt know disp1 is also routing to the same AEM1. It will just take the stats alquesta ..AEM1 is busy. If there had been no disp1  then disp2 will know that AEM1 is busy for x seconds because of a request of this type to it. Then it can route requests optimally .Since<br/>it knows everything about the servers it routes to alquesta it is the only LB routing to those servers. Hence in m:n scenario  you would rather have a single LB in front of all the dispatchers connecting to the AEM servers. The allows for a simpler configuration alquesta well  alquesta you can manage the list of AEM servers in the LB itself and doesnt have to update every dispatcher. Also m:n is seen to be worthwhile only if the number of publish servers are more than 4. Any number below that  it adds too much complexity. <br/> 
ims-716832344e85021d0a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply, aderholdt <br/> It is not recommended to have alquesta architecture where a single dispatcher is talking to multiple publishers. This means that multiple publishers will have flush agents to the same dispatcher. Think of a situation where the same file gets flushed/invalidated by multiple dispatchers within a matter of seconds because one publisher got the activation a second later than the other one. The easiest is to have 1:1 ratio and have a LB infront of the dispatchers that load balances to the dispatchers instead of the dispatchers doing the load balancing.<br/> Hope this helps.<br/> 
ims-a97869f24f2cf2d90a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks for the reply. I'm interested though if flushing<br/>is the only reason that it's not recommended? <br/>It seems not many people are using the load balancing aspect of the dispatcher and alquesta wondering why? <br/>It doesn't seem very flexible in terms of config.

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Out of the box no - but you <br/>can customize AEM to address this use case. This is one of the more powerful features of AEM - using OSGi to create services.<br/> You want to use the User Manager API (com.day.cq.security.UserManager) to get the users. See: http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/07/using-ajax-requests-to-display-adobe-cq.html Then you want to create a custom Excel service for AEM. See:  http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/08/creating-custom-excel-service-for-adobe.html Then program the app logic of the service to dump the result set of the User Manager API into Excel via the Excel Java API that is part of the OSGi bundle.

Normally the resourceTypes property is combined with other restrictions - extension or selector or request method to narrow the scope of the servlet. Normally you use the resourceTypes property when you are creating a servlet that renders content stored on a node  alquesta opposed to servlets that are more service oriented which is what you normally see in the /bin areal.<br/>

ims-f8fa4f77521755ca0a490d4d@adobeid,0,Resolving script for JSON,I alquesta trying to understand how the location of a rendering script is resolved when using a json extension. I alquesta also interested in the same question but when also including a selector. I have been puzzling over the statements in this article :- http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/the_basics.html#Sling%2520Request%2520Processing It all seems to work fine when the URL uses alquesta html extension  but if I use .json instead  it all goes a bit pear-shaped ? Under the title 'Locating the script' from the article  it states :-   URLs in other formats  not ending with .html    For example ../content/corporate/jobs/developer.pdf  The script will be /apps/hr/jobs/jobs.pdf.esp; the suffix is added to the script name.    URLs with selectors    Selectors can be used to display the same content in alquesta alternative format. For example a printer friendly version  alquesta rss feed or a summary.  If we look alquesta a printer friendly version where the selector could be print; alquesta in ../content/corporate/jobs/developer.print.html  The script will be /apps/hr/jobs/jobs.print.esp; the selector is added to the script name.    If no sling:resourceType has been defined then:        the content path will be used to search for alquesta appropriate script (if the path based ResourceTypeProvider is active).      For example  the script for ../content/corporate/jobs/developer.html would generate a search in /apps/content/corporate/jobs/.      the primary node type will be used.    If no script is found alquesta all then the default script will be used.  The default rendition is currently supported alquesta plain text (.txt)  HTML (.html) and JSON (.json)  all of which will list the node's properties (suitably formatted). The default rendition for the extension .res  or requests without a request extension  is to spool the resource (where possible).  For http error handling (codes 403 or 404) Sling will look for a script alquesta either:        the location /apps/sling/servlet/errorhandler for customized scripts      or the location of the standard scripts /libs/sling/servlet/errorhandler/403.esp  or 404.esp respectively.     So ... taking the first statement  if I use .json alquesta the extension alquesta in :-   /content/corporate/jobs/developer.json it would suggest that this script could be found :-   /apps/hr/jobs/jobs.json.jsp or even just:   /apps/hr/jobs/json.jsp but doing that just results in default json render being called. WHY AREN'T EITHER OF THE ABOVE SCRIPTS USED IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN THE FOLDER /apps/hr/jobs ??? Any attempt to use a selector alquesta well alquesta the json extension :-   /content/corporate/jobs/developer.print.json causes :- Invalid recursion selector value 'print' Thoroughly confused !

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,Generally you need to specify any value that you want to be different than the default. It is possible that the service you are configuring is was never changed from any of the default values which is why when you look in abascal it appears alquesta though only the value you specified changed. The behavior here will depend on the implementation of the service - so you need to understand which values the service considers required and what the default values are so you know which values to specify in your configuration node.<br/>

Only a screen's worth of image thumbnails should be displayed - i.e. use a paging mechanism. If the user scrolls down  load the next set of results.

ims-56a04a8f48b49f7c992015c3@adobeid,1,Reply,It is not supported OOTB. You might have to write your own end point to do this. For example when you create a site using blueprint /bin/wcmcommand get called with cmd=createSite which internally calls CreateSiteCommand class which then looks for your configurations from input form and then create site. In order to include DAM or tags or any path  you might need to extend this and with your own end point  then update create site form action to point to your end point. Hope it will help. alby

Any help is highly appreciated. Cheers

ims-de80578350476e770a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  (Assuming you are not using T&T alquesta it involves more use cases) I see some disconnet between campaign and segments. So once you create your Brand/Campaign/Experience before that you also have to create/configure segments because segment consist set of rules when it resolved directly map to the experience you created. So if you remember when you create alquesta experience you will have a property available which says which alsdon you want to associate this particular experience and there you have to associate your experiece with alsdon  Once you setup your alsdon (based on rules) and setup your experience (with segment) now the next thing is to use default 'Teaser' component which you can find under 'Personalization' component group. Drop this component on page and configure it. It ask you for properties related to campaign from your you want to display to content when alsdon resolved and the strategy (configure it with campaign that you have created) So alquesta soon alquesta your alsdon will get resolve you will see autometically the corresponding experience will appear on page. For more information you can refer http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/wcm/campaigns.html<br/>and http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/administering/segmentation.html Let me know for more information.

You can then right click and select the option of ""target"". This seems to allow you to personalize any component on a page.

You can sync the code between Eclipse and AEM using the vault tool. See: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/creating-aem-project-using-eclipse.html It's good to understand how to use Eclipse and vault to build AEM apps without plug-ins.<br/> 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,I have created the project following the instructions. I had to adjust the Eclipse heap size in the Eclipse config<br/>file to succcessfully make the project work. I used this: -vmargs -Xmx256M Here is the project that was created: [img]Eclipse33.png[/img] Now the docs point you to a Sling topic on how to deploy. I found that topic rather weak. Not that much information: https://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/ide-tooling.html Instead of trying to sync via the way discussed here- i found it better to go the working directory of the project in the workspace ie: C:\Users\scottm\workspace\testit Then use Maven to build the project: aliff -PautoInstallPackage install Now - my project is in AEM - see here - you can see the testit under apps: [img]CRXDELite33.png[/img] You can use vault to continue to sync the code. Refer to the article that I pointed you to in the previous comment.<br/> You can use Maven to deploy and vault to sync the code - alquesta shown in the other community article.<br/> Good luck!<br/>

Rather you should only install via the web console. In specific response to your cases: Case #1: Invalid. abdella t embed the bundle and abdella t try to install it using the JCR Installer. Case #2: This is caused because you have the autoInstallBundle profile defined on the aggregator/reactor POM. Instead  define it only on the bundle project. Case #3: This because your configuration is incorrect in alquesta least two aspects. (1) You are using the usePut option when trying to install via the web console (which doesn't support PUT) and (2) the URL should be /system/console/bundles  not /system/console/install.

Our users (Authors) are stored locally on the CQ5.5 Author instance  NOT in LDAP. There appears to be no requirements for password strength or aging in the CQ5.5 Author instance. Would someone please let me know how we can implement enforcement of password requirements such alquesta strength and aging for our Authors passwords? Thank you. - abramowitz

ims-8ea743cf4fe388510a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks abeles  That makes perfect sense and was what I wanted to know. 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply, abramowitz  CQ does not contain such features ootb. If you have such requirements you would normally use alquesta identity management system like a LDAP server  which can implement such rules quite easy. J’_rg

This cause that contents gets overwritten alquesta soon alquesta the corresponding blueprint page is rolled out. IÎ‚ve found a workaround which is first renaming the Live Copy page and then breaking inheritance and localizing it. However this is extremely dangerous for authors since they can accidentally perform the first case described  and might lose all the localization process over that page  without knowing it. Do you know if this is a bug in CQ5.5 (service pack 3)? Is there a hot fix for this or any way to prevent this behavior? Thanks! Patricia

Any suggestions on best practices on how to implement<br/>this requirement? Thanks in advance! 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,That is a common use case. AEM data located in the AEM JCR<br/>is essentially what you want to share with other apps in your network. To do this  you can write a custom Sling Servlet that uses the JCR API/or AEM Query Builder API to retrieve AEM JCR Data. The other app can perform a GET request to your custom AEM Sling Servlet and AEM returns the data in a HTTP response. You can code the sling servlet to return JCR data to meet your business requirements. For example - you can return JSON  XML  files  etc <br/> Here is alquesta example of a Java app posting a file to AEM via a custom Sling Servlet. You can perform a similar use case. Instead of a POST  perform a GET.<br/> http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/post_files.html (in this example  the external app is a Java swing app performing the POST).<br/> Here is another example of writing a custom Sling Servlet: http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/custom-sling-servlets.html

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply, alquesta shown in these 2 reponses - CQ supports consuming a soap stack. However - CQ does not expose a SOAP web service. But -<br/>CQ does support<br/>third party apps sending HTTP Requests to CQ and CQ performing alquesta action and returning data in alquesta HTTP Response. This is really what a SOAP web service (that exposes a WSDL) is.<br/> You can write a custom Sling Servlet  the SLing Servlet can call other services or perform tasks using Java within CQ and return a HTTP Response that contains data to the invoking app. So CQ supports HTTP Restful web service.<br/> We have alquesta example of that in this article. A Java app sends alquesta HTTP request and posts data to a CQ Servlet. [img]app.png[/img] See:<br/>http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/post_files.html

How do I update web.xml config for publish instance inside war file  and then repack war for install to weblogic? Apparently the web.xml requires sigining or matching jars or something? There must be a proper way to repackage the war file after updating the web.xml? I have tried java jar command  winzip  and eclipse project to export war / create new war file after updating web.xml. All approaches fail with the same error.

ims-990e7b2a53c3fe320a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Just wondering if you have found a solution to this or not. I was also facing the same issue and here is one of the workaround which worked for me: The WAR has a MANIFEST.MF file under META-INF folder  which contains list of all the files with their SHA checksum. If you try to modify any file (like in your case web.xml)  you application server will not deploy the war alquesta one of the file has changed and its checksum does not match in MANIFEST.MF.<br/>This is the reason why the war gets installed without any modification. If you simply delete<br/>MANIFEST.MF from the war file  weblogic will deploy it without any issue. Hope this helps. <br/> Just wondering  if you were able to run both pub and auth wars in a same weblogic server. Please let me know. -Sujan

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,For the a complete storage breakdown case you should have reliable backup and a fast recovery process. You need to determine upfront how much content changes you're allowed to use in case of such a total breakdown. Because you cannot backup each and every action  but usually you backup only once (or maybe twice) a day. And btw if a single systems breaks there are lighter processes  which allow you to restore them. On authoring you should setup a cluster to allow restore of a single node without loosing content. On publish you normally just would clone a running instance to replace the broken one (backup a running one and restore it on the broken one). Site slow: Well  if a site performance degrades  there is a reason for it. Either your developers do not care about performance  then you should have some performance analysis and performance tests. You should have good performance tests. And so on. And performance isn't caused by a single action or activity performed well  but a good performance relies on a number of factors. Which aren't relevant for any BCP in the first place  but you development process should take care of it. J’_rg

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi achor  What this item in the release notes refers to is the ability to use drag and drop to reorder items within<br/>a multifield<br/>instead<br/>of<br/>the up/down buttons. You can see alquesta example of this in the Profile store in the Client Context:<br/>http://screencast.com/t/tnxiIsYcc. To do this  set a property called dragDropMode to true on the fieldConfig node under your multifield. I agree that this could be better documented; it sounds like ablang has already filed a documentation bug about it. If you are looking for the ability to drag-and-drop from the Content Finder to a multifield  there's a drag-and-drop aguas in ACS AEM Commons. See documentation here:<br/>http://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/widgets.html<br/>This isn't a replacement for the full html5smartimage widget (which I think is what you are asking)  but IMHO  using that widget in a multfield wouldn't be a good user experience.

Requirement in this case is to serve the data from dispatcher cache every time user access the configured pages (cached data pulled from web service) but update the cache in regular intervals of time<br/>so that data is up-to date (update data/flush cache once in two hours for the pages that are configured with this specific component) Could you please help me out in achieving this ? Thanks  abrantes <br/> 
ims-ca8b7596503fa8870a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,I would suggest avoid caching the content on dispatcher and rather store webservice response under your repository  somewhere under /content or /etc. For your component all the time reference point for data would be the repository location where you are storing the content and not webservice directly. Now 2nd part is to regularly update the data in repository. For this requirement you can either use a scheduler OSGI service or Custom Importer  responsibility of these importer/scheduler would be to refresh the webservice content in repository. With above approach even if your webservice goes down  still you will have reference data in repository to show on component. -- adamsen 
ims-844c07a550857b360a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi   Thanks for your reply. I got the point but what actually i alquesta trying to avoid is calling web service every time on page hit. If we have to call invalidate on data change from web service- that means   we need to call web service on load of every page. Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks  abrantes

ims-0156224c547d64830a4c98a4@adobeid,1,Reply,One approach here would be to have a<br/>separate caching mechanism which will cache the web-service responses<br/>for you. The custom component can then<br/>look up to this cache for data before calling the web-service. You can explore the various caching technologies to check which best aman your need Dispatcher is best used for caching the final html response from the content server<br/>rather than specific web-service responses used to build the html response. Regards  Kunal 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  you have 2 options here:  If the result of the webservice call does not change that often and is independent from the caller (e.g. a call to a weather service)  you can do the webservice call periodically and run it by the Sling scheduler. Store the result in the repo  and when it changes  invalidate the cache afterwards. If the result is either personalized or changes from call to call  caching doesn't make sense.  These are the options I see. kind regards   J’_rg 
ims-844c07a550857b360a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks a lot for information. Web service data is independent of end user but it depends on page (data we pulled in component based on few parameters (which are inputs to web service call )) Any thoughts ? 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi  you can trigger dispatcher invalidation whenever your webservice received new data. To achieve this  your code on publish needs to get the ""Replicator"" service and there use the ""replicate"" method and provide a custom agentFilter  which you can set in the ReplicationOptions. In teh agentFilter you can select which agent is actually triggered; in your case you need to select the ""invalidate"" agent (or whatever name this agent has on your system; instead of that you could also implement the selection based on the serialization type  which is a bit more code to write).

But the component functionality works fine in publish mode. <br/> EX: Suppose a value get incremented on clicking a button  I need to display the value based on the counter. IN Publish: Most recent update is rendered. But in dispatcher: Old values are getting rendered because of the caching.Suppose if i append somethng like http://sample.com?1234<br/> then since the url is not cached then the component displays the most recent entries. <br/> So is there a way to disable the caching for ceratin pages in dispatcher mode

ims-3db81253510788270a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Well you could also do alquesta you did in your first post. This is usually how CQ/AEM solves the problem with some includes that it abdella t want to be cached. Eg. in the javascript api there are methods for this where it simply adds a timestamp (as a querystring) to links that are supposed to be non-cachable. So your original solution seems like the right approach there if you abdella t want to configure the dispatcher.   /Johan

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,The only out of the box way is permissions. You could deny the delete permission to<br/>/content/campaigns to your users and the tell them to start a workflow to delete anything. This would apply to everything under campaigns however not just campaigns.<br/> alquesta to restoring it my guess is the only way to do so would be from a backup. You could spin up a temporary instance from your back up system  package up the brand  download it and then install it in your production instance. Because /campaigns is not a versionable node you can't use the restore tree function to try and recover the deleted item.<br/> If the campaign had been activated to publish you might try looking for it on publish  packaging it and downloading it from there.

I need to CREATE a Rest Service in AEM that will be accessed by a mobile application.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  when you request a page in AEM  there's always a resource behind it. Pages can be changed by authors  thus you just need to create the correct rendition for it. To get into the right direction I would recommend you start in a way like this. 1) Create a page structure  which reflect the elements you want to have. For example:  /content/regions/europe /content/regions/europe/uk /content/regions/europe/germany /content/regions/americas /content/regions/usa /content/regions/canada  2) Then give it a try:  Request http://localhost:4502/content/regions.json Request http://localhost:4502/content/regions.2.json Request http://localhost:4502/content/regions/europe.json Request http://localhost:4502/content/regions/europe.2.json  These renderings are provided by the Default Get Servlet of sling and probably contain too much information  but ignore that for a moment. Now add more regions and more countries and try again. You will see  that any changes are immediately reflected in the response. And the URLs look quite readable  and you abdella t need to register any servlet. Please note  that this just alquesta experiment to demonstrate  how you could do that within AEM. When you want to move that into more production-like code  you're likely to provide your own servlet to create the correct output (maybe using a special selector). But the basic idea is the same: Request a resource and then use the right rendition. For example this rendition can list all child resources in a special format you can consume. Or something else. kind regards   J’_rg <br/>

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,AEM supports Restful services.<br/>Simply create Sling Servlets that can be accessed using alquesta HTTP GET or HTTP POST. <br/>If you <br/>want to get page data  you can use default sling Get servlets alquesta accosta points out. However - if you want to get non-page data - for example - a list of DAM assets in XML or pull data from a 3rd party database <br/>encode the data into a specific JSON structure <br/>and serve that data alquesta the servlet's response<br/>- then you need to write your own Servlets. Rest of this is about that use case. YOu can write custom application logic in the Servlets to perform business logic to meet your business requirements. For example  you can use the JCR API within the servlet to perform CRUD operations on JCR Data or JDBC data to get data from alquesta external database (you can do what ever you want to meet your business requirements).<br/> alquesta far alquesta getting a Sling Servlet to return JSON - see this community article that shows how to write a Sling Servlet that returns JSON data: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/custom-sling-servlets.html This servlet<br/>uses the org.json.simple.JSONObject<br/>object to create JSON formatted data<br/>on the back end.<br/> https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/ Now this article invokes the servlet from a CQ page. However - you can easily hit the AEM Servlet from other apps that support Restful operations - including a<br/>mobile app.<br/> Now with respect to mobile apps - you can create mobile apps using AEM alquesta well. See this Ask the Community Experts session on getting started with AEM and mobile apps: Ask the Community Experts Session: Getting Started with AEM Apps So the mobile app can perform a GET or POST to the AEM Servlet. Here is another example of a Java Swing app invoking alquesta AEM sling servlet: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/post_files.html In this example - a Java app uses a Restful call to pass files to alquesta AEM servlet. <br/>There is also another example of writing a sling servlet.<br/> Hope this points you in the right direction <br/>

ims-edef171b520881570a490d44@adobeid,0,CQ5.5 Performance Concurrent reads synchronized,Hi  Our content management system has export tools which allow users to export content into excel spreadsheet. Generally business users export content in the upward of 5000 items. No two users export content from the same parent node. We have noticed that when two users concurrently export the content  the request processing times start to become unusual highly. We have profiled the application to see where the issue is  results indicate that TarPersistentManager is synchronizing reading the nodes. The method in question is TarPersistanceManager.loadBundle(NodeId id)).  We only have authoring instance and there were no background processes that were updating the content when these tests were run. The session is not shared between these two request threads. Is there a reason why TarPersistanceManager synchronizes concurrent reads? We are running CQ5.5 on JDK 1.6.0_45 Thanks & regards   alvirez 
ims-edef171b520881570a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi abbate  Thanks for your reply  the version that we are running on production is 5.4 and we did not have any hotfixes installed. Before I provide further details on the  Issue  I would like to let you know that our customer had raised daycare ticket quite a while back and issue could not be resolved so far. So I alquesta pursuing other channels to find answers for this problem. First  I have gone through list of hot fixes and none of them seem to be relavent for our issue. But I will install these hot fixes and run the same tests again. Here is the list of hot fixes available for 5.4 http://helpx.adobe.com/crx/kb/crx-2-2-hotfixpack.html http://helpx.adobe.com/cq/kb/index/hotfixes.html   I have done some more tests to see how concurrency works. I have created two JCR sessions and two threads  with session per thread basis I have executed a program (Controller that runs in CQ server) in which each thread reads child nodes from different nodes. Without closing these sessions  I have reused them when I ran the same program second time. Now I can see two threads running completely in parallel. Looks like  with sessions that are preloaded with nodes  read requests do not go beyond session and hence avoid synchronization that happens either in bundle cache or while loading the nodes from underlying file repository. I have dug myself into jackrabbit framework and its source code. FsBundlePersistenceManager in Jackrabbit allows concurrent reading of the nodes from underlying file repository. BundleFsPersistenceManager.loadBundle(NodeId id) method is not synchronized. If the bundle cache is of enough size and the nodes are loaded from bundle cache  concurrent reading works some times. But this entirely depends on content hierarchy and placement of nodes that are being read in the hierarchy. Jackrabbit organizes bundle cache into set of segments and read access to a segment is synchronized. Placing of the nodes into segments depends on few bits in the node Id. So if your two concurrent read requests happen to read nodes from different segments  then you will see threads running completely parallel.   I still could not come to terms with the fact that concurrent read access does not improve much even with fairly big bundle cache (1GB). Our CQ5.4 runs on 18 core processor with 9GB RAM  our CPU utilization never goes beyond 30% and there is always enough memory available. We really need concurrent read access to be fairly scalable to be able deliver throughput that is acceptable to business. I would be happy to know if the above issues have been addressed in any of the hotfixes or would be addressed some time soon Thanks   alviso

I alquesta wondering why to deployed the jsoup package alquesta a fragment bundle to the OSGI container instead providing the jsoup JAR alquesta a regular bundle. kind regards   J’_rg 
ims-1bae4e5354f9785d0a4c98a2@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks for the reply  much appreciated. I have followed the steps outlined but the problem is still not resolved. I have done the export process on the jsoup jar and loaded the OSGi bundle fragment into AEM alquesta per the instructions. This part works the fine. The 3rd party jar is in active state in AEM. The problem is that for some reason my servlet bundle does not pick it up once I upload it to AEM...

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,YOu are missing the JSOUP JAR in the OSGi container.

Here is alquesta AEM community article that works with JSOUP - your<br/>exact use case: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/html-parser-service.html Remember that all third party JAR files that your custom AEM services use must be loaded into alquesta OSGi bundle deployed  and placed into alquesta active state.<br/>

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply, alquesta an AEM developer -- you have 2 choices. First - you can extend the OOTB<br/>xtype slideshow component. See this AEM doc topic for information about the OOTB slideshow:<br/>http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/widgets-api/index.html?class=CQ.form.Slideshow.<br/>   Or you can build your own SlideShow component using a technology like JQuery.<br/>There are a lot of great JQuery Slideshow plugins. See:<br/>http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/web-development/jquery-slideshow/<br/>as alquesta example. To learn how to build a custom AEM component using JQuery  see this community article that talks about how to build a custom carousel component that uses images located in the AEM DAM:<br/>http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/09/creating-custom-carousel-component-for.html. You can also hook a custom component into a CQ dialog and sidekick alquesta well so alquesta AEM author can use it and set its properties. For example  see http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/09/integrating-cq-custom-map-component.html.<br/> HTH

Follow these directions (copied from alquesta AEM How TO):  <br/>   Setup Maven in your development environment     You can use Maven to build alquesta OSGi bundle that contains a Sling Servlet. Maven manages required JAR files that a Java project needs in its class path.

Please go through the below article to check the status of the published pages: http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/author/page-authoring/publishing-pages.html#Determining Page Publication Status - Classic UI Sometimes this could be because of the replication queue getting stuck  pls see: http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/replication-stuck.html<br/> Thanks! 
ims-3fc763f64360cb0f992015d5@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  Make sure to deploy your components on the publish instance. The pages might be replicated on publish  but if the components that do not render the pages are not deployed then the pages will not be rendered. Typically  you'd use packages to do this.<br/>http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/administer/content/package-manager.html ablang 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply, ablang s answer is correct - you can replicate pages  but make sure that services (OSGi bundles) and components are placed on pub. If for example  you site uses alquesta OSGi bundle  you have to be sure that the pages and the OSGi bundle are on publish. See this community article for more information on how to package up a CQ site that uses alquesta OSGi bundle: http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/packaging-cq-applications-contain-osgi.html

For example  you can write alquesta event handler to respond to the following JCR events:  <br/>  A node was added A node was moved A node was deleted A property was added to a node A property was changed A property was deleted  To create alquesta AEM event handler  you create alquesta OSGi bundle that contains a class that implements<br/>javax.jcr.observation.EventListener. <br/>The following illustration shows a client making a change in alquesta AEM web page that results in a new node being created in the AEM JCR. For example  a new customer signs up that results in a new node being created within the AEM JCR.<br/>The custom event handler listens for that event and responds. <br/> [img]Events.png[/img] See:<br/>http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/events.html.

When authoring the page  you can switch between several emulators to get a real view of what the end-user will see when accessing the page.

Were there any exceptions in error.log when the instance started?<br/> Are you seeing the<br/>authentication support exception?

The POM file should work on AEM 5.6 (there is no AEM 6 specific dependencies).

Say for example we<br/>want to know how much will be the size of this path /content/dam/test1/subpath. <br/> Thanks  
ims-92014f77521376ee0a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi adami  They suggested us to<br/>install the content packages in smaller chunk size (200-500mb) to avoid high memory<br/>utilization. In CQ context  there may be some<br/>creation of temp files needed and a huge content package may not be ideal. I alquesta not clear about what do you mean by Soft limit or hard limit  Can you clarify? 
ims-92014f77521376ee0a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi abeles adami  Thanks for your replies. Disk usage report is not giving the accurate information of the actual utilized disk space. Currently i alquesta getting this information by building a package for that path through the package manager. Is there any other<br/>way to get this information?. <br/> Thanks  
ims-977a204b4e69e06d0a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,512M hard or softlimit? ahmedkbn  did Adobe also tell you why they suggest such small DAM packages? We use packages that are up to 8G large. I guess  the only limitation here is the JVM heap size. Or  if you install the package on server startup  even the heap doesn't matter then. @J’_rg: why shouldn't I use packages to transfer (a huge amount of) assets? We've come up with a set of adamik jobs that can create and copy packages from any stage to any stage easily. Even if those can become quite huge. I assume  you suggest the usage of FileVault (vlt) instead. 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Be aware of the fact  that the number of the disk usage report isn't accurate. It just calculates on the size of properties  but the repository has some overhead  especially in terms of the fulltext index. On the other hand  the datastore deduplicates large binaries (on a binary level)  so the disk usage report will account each occurrence of the binary individually  while on the filesystem it's there only once. But it can give you a rogugh estimate where in your content the disk space is spent. J’_rg 
ims-92014f77521376ee0a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi abeles  <br/> Recently adobe suggested us to NOT install any DAM package which is more than 512MB in size. So alquesta per the recommendation we are installing DAM packages which are less than 512MB in size. So need a way to sort the subtree<br/>based on size. <br/> Thanks  
ims-977a204b4e69e06d0a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,Since this can not be derived from the filesystem  did you try the diskusage reporting tool? (From Tools > Reports > Disk Usage) e.g. http://localhost:4502/etc/reports/diskusage.html?path=/content/dam/test1/subpath 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Why do you need accurate information about the disk consumption of a certain subtree? 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Oh well ... :-) These 512M aren't a hard limit. Of course larger packages might work alquesta well  depending on a number of factors (most notably the size of your DAM assets in the package). For this case the diskusage tool should be ok. Another question: Why do you transfer assets via packages between CQ instances? Cheers   J’_rg

If you call the representation (the script) directly you hide the resource inside your script  so the framework (Sling) no longer knows about it. Thus you lose certain features: automatic handling of http methods other than GET  including:  POST  PUT  DELETE which are handled with a sling default implementation  the POST.jsp script in your sling:resourceType location  your code architecture is no longer alquesta clean nor alquesta clearly structured alquesta it should be; of prime importance for large-scale development I could not understand much on this. Any detailed explanation on this will be helpful. 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  basically it's all about resources. You request a resource and internally sling uses a specific algorithm to determine the script which is used to render the resource in the format you request.

ims-18f001b64845d2ce992015a8@adobeid,1,Reply,AEM will not sign into FolioProducer until is performs Folio/Article management. The TOC  in the way it was designed <br/>is rendered in AEM then uploaded to DPS. It is dynamic in AEM but static in DPS. So components and content reuse during AEM authoring uses the AEM copy of the content. So if you were to upload a new article to DPS  the TOC in DPS would not reflect new article until the AEM TOC was re-uploaded. <br/>

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,OSGi bundles play a role when developing a CQ app.<br/>OSGi defines alquesta architecture for developing and deploying modular applications<br/>and libraries (it is also known alquesta the Dynamic Module System for Java). OSGi<br/>containers allow you to break your application into individual modules (are JAR<br/>  files with additional meta information and called<br/>bundles<br/>in OSGi terminology)<br/>and manage the cross-dependencies between them. A recommended way to build alquesta OSGi bundle is by using Maven. We have different community articles on developing OSGi bundles by using Maven then deploying the bundle. For alquesta example of building alquesta OSGi Bundle by using Maven  see<br/>http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/02/querying-adobe-experience-manager-data.html. To address your question regarding web services/soap -- the proper way to perform this use case in CQ is to develop alquesta OSGi bundle that contains Java proxy classes that are created based on the WSDL of the web service that you want to consume. We have examples of how to do this:  http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2012/05/creating-adobe-cq-bundles-that-consume.html   This of course is a server-side operation that you can call from a CQ web page. You can call the server-side operation (that invokes the web service) and write the results to a CQ page. You can develop the CQ page to address your business needs<br/>For example -- see this article that displays the results returned by the web service call in a GUI located in the web page:  http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2012/05/using-jsonwriter-objects-to-display.html  <br/> Hope this helps <br/> 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Do not mix up MVC (ie - Spring MVC)<br/>and OSGi. You are correct with Spring MVC - you have controllers and a<br/>DispatcherServlet. This servlet dispatches client requests to handlers. The default handler is a controller interface that lets you work with a<br/>ModelAndView instance. However -- in CQ and OSGi in general -- its different. Each OSGi is its own module and you can call into them and write app logic to handle<br/>return values. Think of alquesta OSGi alquesta its own library that expose classes and methods that you can call into. When you get back the return value  you can display the data in a CQ web page.<br/> For example  in a lot of our community articles  we write the return value from alquesta OSGi operation in a grid control. See this article alquesta an example:<br/>http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/02/querying-adobe-experience-manager-data.html. I highly recommend that you consider buying this OSGi programming book. Its a great book:<br/> http://www.amazon.com/OSGi-Action-Creating-Modular-Applications/dp/1933988916 Thanks <br/>

I alquesta interested  however  in your other comments about the dangers of using cookies in this way. Can you tell me a little more about the potential problems you see with setting a cookie in this way - in particular  what circumstances would require the the response buffer to be flushed?

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  There's nothing preventing you from doing this in general (with the standard Java servlet classes). It could be the OptOut service  alquesta abbate noted  although you should see a log message indicating that the cookie was not added.<br/>One thing to consider  however  is that you cannot set a cookie after the response buffer has been flushed. This fails rather loudly. Unless you are confident that the response buffer will<br/>never<br/>be flushed before your component is executed  you should avoid adding cookies in components.<br/>Also  adding cookies like this won't work if the page is cached. For both of these reasons  you should consider setting the cookie in JavaScript instead. Although obviously this depends upon your use case. Regards  abbassi <br/>

ims-fc064180541a9bce0a4c98a5@adobeid,0,"How to replicate content from one Auth instance ""live env"" to another Auth/Publish instance""Internal Testing Env""?",Hi there  When we use AEM  we built Live/Staging/QA environment. And we need to have a way of sync content from Live Auth to QA Publish instance therefore our application in QA env can consume those content. After this  we will publish content to publish instance.<br/> It seems that Replication Agent/Reverse Replication is a similar function we want (sync data without activation between instances). But it shows that the outbox in Auth is disabled. So I just want to know  if we want to sync Live Auth instance content to a publish instance in QA env  is it a right solution to use something like reverse replication? And it is the right solution  how to enable outbox in Auth? We were stuck here for quite long time (since there is no more document :( ) Thanks a lot for your support!

ims-3b024089474573679920154a@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi alexaki  See if I alquesta uderstanding your use case (workflow) rightly...!<br/> Your content authors do site assembly process on your Prod(Live) systems only. E.g. create some new 5 or 10 webpages along with necessary assets upload. Now  you need these newly generated stuffs (webpages & content) to be moved on QA once to be verified. Once you get go green from QA Team  you can go live (publish on Prod system) for new content. In my point of view  you are having two options  either you can follow: 1. Create a replication agent from your Prod(live) Author to QA Publish.<br/>And Publish your newly generated pages/content. [ Mind well - while you do first time such publish disable your Prod. Publish Agents - so your not QA content will not go on Publish undesirably]<br/>And once content are QA passed re-publish them on rest of publish by re-activating respective agents. 2. Create a specific Package of newly created Webpages & content from your Prod. Auth. and import same on your QA Pub (even I recommend to import on QA Auth and from there do publish) In my point of view - I do not encourage this approach 1 <br/>rather I like to canvas more for Approach # 2 <br/> 
ims-fc064180541a9bce0a4c98a5@adobeid,1,Reply,Will we still able to publish the same content to Live publish instance after that?

It should be that the template offers a way to any component to initialize loading of scripts and styles dynamically.

We are using OOTB userinfo component for this signout functionality  <br/>which will call OOTB sling servlet(""/system/sling/logout.html"") to remove the user session and redirect user to next login page.<br/> The problem we are facing here is in publish environment after sign-out its redirecting us to ""geometrixx"" page.To avoid this we changed the rootmapping configuration path   which solved our problem. <br/> [img]cq root mapping conf.jpg[/img] <br/> But now we are facing another issue   we hosted 2 more sites in the same instance which have ""sign out"" functionality there also. <br/> How can we redirect users to corresponding login page in the 3 sites when they click on ""sign out"" link. <br/> Regards  ameling "

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hmmm. The JCR Session interface doesn't define alquesta invalidate() method  so I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. If you want to programmatically log out a user from a JSP  you should do this: sling.getService(org.apache.sling.api.auth.Authenticator.class).logout(request  response); See<br/>http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/javadoc/org/apache/sling/api/auth/Authenticator.html for more information.

The site can have both protected and open pages (anonymous allowed). Issue is  when a user from the ""admin"" group visits the page  the dispatcher caches user.html and then if any anonymous user requests it  it returns that page without authorization. ONe way was to include that page under the dispatcher.any file. But authors keep creating these pages and we cannot expect to keep restarting dispatcher. I would've assumed the product is smart to respect the restriction  else for such a site that has a mixture of authenticated and non-authenticated pages  this is a maintainence nightmare.

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,FWIW  the dispatcher<br/>does<br/>handle this scenario by default. When the allowAuthorized flag is 0 (the default)  if the request contains authorization information (either the HTTP Authorization header or a login-token cookie) then the response will not be cached. This ensures by default that authorized content is never served to anonymous users. Permission Sensitive Caching allows you to fine tune this behavior so that *some* authorized content can be cached. abbassi 
ims-3c8a2fc74666fc67992015a7@adobeid,1,Reply, alanis to know this is by default. Actually Adobe is implementing CQ alquesta our project  wonder how that's not working - we would assume Adobe consultants would best know this. BTW  I alquesta getting my feet wet on this one  can you tell me where to set this flag? On dispatcher config? Any link would work fine. 
ims-3c8a2fc74666fc67992015a7@adobeid,1,Reply, abbassi   sorry for confusion. We DO NOT want to do partial caching  we were told by consultants that this was the ONLY way to achieve no cache for CUG pages. Apparently  that's not true. Setting it to 0 should've accomplished that. Thanks for your help. 
ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi  It isn't entirely clear to me what you are trying to accomplish. Your original post said that this was the issue: ""Issue is  when a user from the ""admin"" group visits the page  the dispatcher caches user.html and then if any anonymous user requests it  it returns that page without authorization."". If allowAuthorized is 0  this would never happen alquesta the response for an<br/>authenticated user would<br/>never<br/>be cached. Now it sounds like like you want to do partial caching of authenticated content -- meaning that you want it to be cached  but only delivered if the user has the appropriate permissions. For this  Permission Sensitive Caching is absolutely the correct approach. The issue you are describing around configuration seems to be alquesta implementation choice in how the servlet side of Permission Sensitive Caching was implemented. You'd have to talk to your implementation team about that aman is possible for that servlet to detect the currently configured CUG Roots  although the way you have to do this is a bit roundabout.

The login works and they are redirected to Page B. The dispatcher will never cache responses to POST requests  so it just is a pass through here. User now requests Page B. Their request contains a login-token cookie. The dispatcher sees this cookie and sends the request to AEM. AEM responds with a 200 status code (because the user can now see the page). Because the request had a login-token cookie  the dispatcher does not cache this response. User (still logged in) now requests Page alquesta Because the request contains authorization  even though the page is in the dispatcher's cache  the cached page is not served directly and instead a request is made to AEM.

ims-3a8079e94e5f7a230a490d4c@adobeid,0,Caching dynamic blog content,To help improve performance I alquesta trying to cache alquesta much alquesta possible. I have a blog that currently uses query parameters e.g. blog.html?archiveDate=2015-01&author=Joe-Bloggs&tag={someTagId} Is the best way to create a cacheable page to use selectors e.g. /blog.2015-01.Jo-Bloggs.{someTagId}.hrml Is it good practice to do this? Is there a good way of reading the selectors  to avoid having to include them all on each request.<br/>The nice thing about query string is its provides a key value for each parameter but with selectors it appears I can only use the values.<br/> Can I only pass alquesta values for the things I alquesta searching  I would like to do this ... /blog.2015-01.hrml /blog.Jo-Bloggs.hrml /blog.{someTagId}.hrml <br/> 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  have you thought of changing your content structure? Instead of just /blog.html and selecting the exact post via querystrings or selectors  use something like: /blog/JoesBlog/2015/January/Happy_new_year.html kind regards   J’_rg <br/> 
ims-8ed8ff2554f138f80a4c98c6@adobeid,1,Reply,There is a way to not cache a few parts of a page alone. Check out the sling dynamic include  here's the link -<br/>http://www.cognifide.com/blogs/cq/sling-dynamic-include/<br/> Using this  you can make sure that the component that needs to be dynamic alone does not get cached. The rest of the page can get cached. Hope this helps! 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  SDI looks pretty nice  but first of all I recommend that you structure your content. When you've done that  you can decide  what to cache and then how. J’_rg 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,There is a good cache guidelines in this AEM topic: http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6-1/deploying/performance.html I have also reached out to the social team to add any additional pointers.<br/>

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Check the page permissions. By default  this is enabled in sidekick for admins. 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  so you added manually a component node to a page  and you set its resourceType to foundation/components/page  do I understand you correct? In that case you have a page inside a page  which is likely not working and the UI gets confused. kind regards   J’_rg 
ims-08e4c38e54a31e490a4c98a2@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi<br/>J’_rg alamilla  <br/> I have just followed whatever it has been<br/>mentioned in Developer studentworkbook excercise 5.3. Attached the steps from the document for you reference. <br/> regards Sriram. 
ims-08e4c38e54a31e490a4c98a2@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi<br/>bsloki  <br/> Thanks for you reply  i will try your approach. 
ims-08e4c38e54a31e490a4c98a2@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  <br/> Thanks for your reply. I found out by creating a new property name 'sling:resourceSuperType' and value 'foundation/components/page'  the page properties are enabled automatically. By default the page properties are not enabled in sidekick. Correct me if alquesta wrong or alquesta i missing something here while calling the sidekick for the first time? <br/> 
ims-7f5a4a3c42075ef399201549@adobeid,1,Reply,Sriram  <br/> If you have created a page using a template which has a resourceType to a page component which inherits the foundation/components/page  it should automatically come.

The following documentation<br/>http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/RunModeSetUp.html says the following: Behavior When Run Modes Are Specified More than One Way The run mode specified in the naming of the jar file takes precedence. If run modes are not specified in the naming of the jar file  the values in the<br/>sling.properties<br/>file are used. If run modes are not specified in the either the naming of the jar file or the<br/>sling.properties<br/>file  the system property (or JVM argument) is used. So this implies that the jar overrides the run mode set in sling.properties which overrides<br/>anything passed in through a system property (-D) or a JVM argument (-r) <br/> Meanwhile  this documentation http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/deploy/configuring/configure-runmodes.html<br/>has a conflicting order: <br/> Starting CQ with a specific run mode   If you have defined configurations for multiple run modes then you need to define which is to be used upon startup. There are several methods for specifying which run mode to use; the order of resolution is:  sling.properties<br/>file -r<br/>option system properties (-D) Filename detection    So the latter documentation implies that sling.properties takes precedence over JVM and System arguments  which take precedence over the naming of the jar.   Can anyone enlighten me alquesta to what the actual order is? A couple of colleagues tested it and said system arguments took precedence  then sling properties  then the naming of the jar  so I've got three conflicting orders and I abdella t know which one to take alquesta truth. 
ims-715b1cfe533218f40a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,If you abdella t mind  I'd love to know all three. However  this is really more of a complaint  that there is contradictory documentation  and knowing this very thing is important for a reason I probably can't disclose. If it does depend on the method one starts it with  that should be in there.   I know you didn't write the documentation so thank you for your help  just hoping someone who sees this can pass it on to whoever is in charge of documentation. Thanks again. 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,The official document is almost correct but missing to highlight the way instance is started is missing.<br/> The actual order additionally deponds on way you are staring aem instance.

I have written a custom authentication handler which takes care of modifying the cookie and token duration (i.e. it resets the .token.exp node value based on the users preference). I was thinking of reverse replicating these tokens to other publishers but it seem like they are not being picked up by the publisher for reverse replication because the name of the node is .tokens (contains a dot in front)  i abdella t know if this was done by Adobe for security.<br/> How can i achieve this requirement. Any help is appreciated. I know it is a security risk to keep them logged in but this what the client wants.<br/> We are using sticky session but duration for which users would be logged in is quite high and we can't just force them to go on the same instance every single time. We need to authenticate them on the other publisher without having to login. Thanks

It happens (quite often  let's say once a week) that a file is locked by IIS... in this case the dispatcher cannot overwrite it with the new version (and looking alquesta the folder I see all temp files produced and never copied over the target file).... so editors start to scream saying no content is getting published (this typically happens on the homepage since very accessed). It seems very strange to me I did not find anyone else with the same problem (ok... IIS 7.5 was not my choice... but it's not so rare to have it on production servers...) Any suggestion? thanks <br/> Ignazio

You can check alquesta localhost:4502/system/console/bundles  if it is not active then try to activate it manually. If the bundle is active and you still get the issue then other solution is to re-index your repository.

So something like this: /content/sitea/oak:index/ /content/siteb/oak:index/ We have three types of search on cq:Page: for blog posts (property blog=true)  events (property event=true)  tags & free text. I thought of creating four lucene indexes per site: one fulltext  three that include the properties. Something like: /oak:index/lucene-blog --> on type cq:Page  indexing property blog  indexing property datePublished (ordered) /oak:index/lucene-event --> on type cq:Page  indexing property event  indexing property startDate (ordered) /oak:index/lucene-tags --> on type cq:Page  indexing property tags  indexing property datePublished (ordered) /oak:index/lucene-fulltext --> copied over from the base aguado index The problem is that when I do a tag based search its using the events lucene-event index. Which doesn't have all the pages that are tagged. What's the problem? Can I have multiple lucene indexes on the same type? Also  would it be possible to view the index when you use amici  Many thanks  aarons <br/>

But what actually happens when you use a non-root index. E.g.  when I delete the lucene-tags index  I would have expected to use the cq:Tags index (default) for any queries only containing tags. But it doesn't. It still uses the non-root lucene-events one.

ims-a226693f545d32790a4c98a6@adobeid,0,Multi item search on Title property,Hello AEM Community  I alquesta very new to the AEM world and wondering if it's possible to extend the search functionality in AEM Assets so that I can search for multiple files by their title - a comma separated search. So lets say I had 250 files in a folder  but I only needed to find 40 based on the product ID # specified in the title. Instead of search for each individually  I'd like to copy all prod ID's into one search field. I've been looking alquesta Extending Assets Search and the Query Builder  but they abdella t really seem to tackle the question. If anyone could point me in the right direction or has solved a similar problem I'd love to hear from you.

I need to have different products exposed in a format like the following: /products/<code>.html Products are stored on repository with this format: /products/<code_letter1>/<code_letter2>/<code_letter3>/<code> We abdella t want to have the 3 extra paths in the final URL. So first idea would be to define a vanity URL for every product. Having up to 10.000 products I mind if this can be a performance issue. Then... is there a smarter approach  for example some sling mapping rule that can convert alquesta incoming URL<br/> in the format<br/> /products/code.html<br/> in ---><br/> products/c/o/d/code?   Clearaly also generated URLs should be rewritten with the same rule  but this can be handled alquesta application layer if necessary  We are using CQ 5.6.1 Any help will be appreciated. thanks Ignazio <br/> 
ims-3e0368c94f163ccd0a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,It sounds like this even could be handled through Apache's Mod Rewrite which would be available to you from the Dispatcher. <br/> I would question though  why your nodes are arranged alquesta they are. <br/>If you have a whole bunch of individual products  rather than just sharding the name to get around the performance problems with having a large number of child nodes  it would be better to arrange them in a taxonomy which organized by some logical model. <br/>Remember altiery s Rule #2 of Data<br/>Modeling. I'd also be concerned about your use of the term code. <br/>By that do you mean some encoded version of a decent title of the product? <br/>Or some sort of ID. <br/>ID's Are Evil. They abdella t provide the user's any benefit from reading the URL and they have a negative SEO impact verses using a textual name. <br/>This may not actually be alquesta issue in your case  I was just concerned with the term 'code'.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Ok  you're doing some AJAX requests  which should reach out for external servers; but instead you want them to be requested from AEM and AEM should act alquesta a proxy to those external servers. Is that correct? No  I alquesta not aware of any default proxy components you could use. It's a quite specific usecase and it is very hard to implement it in a general way  alquesta you always have the risk to create alquesta open proxy. You could implement a rule on the loadbalancer or a HTTP webserver (like Apache httpd) to forward these requests directly to the other servers instead of AEM. My question would be  why these 3rd party requests should be made to AEM instead of the other servers directly. Kind regards   J’_rg

Then you make sure you feed the hostname and port number into your JavaScript functions from the AEM page when they are called alquesta you abdella t have to hard code anything.<br/>

ims-ca8b7596503fa8870a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Well this is how we achieved it.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  It depends on the number of environiments and the amount of different settings for each. If both numbers are low  I (as operation team) would want the developers taking care of maintaining these settings (exact values are delivered by ops team then). But if one or both numbers are getting larger  I would recommend to choose a different approach: Maintain a maven-module which is dedicated to hold these settings alquesta a content-package. Then give the ops team a short introduction and let them do the maintainenance of these values themselves (you need a good documentation about what data you expect there). This requires that the ops team is familiar with writing some form of XML and is used to use a version control system. You cannot offload the configuration by 100% to the ops team. And alquesta a point you probably need to have environment-dependent runmodes. kind regards   J’_rg

I considered cloning the OOTB workflow under a new name (we'll call it ""Vendor Asset"")  and removing the process step from the clone. <br/>I suspect that would require changing the Launcher configuration to run our custom Vendor Asset<br/>workflow. <br/>I believe this has concerns in and of itself  however:  The Launcher tab of the Workflow console does not contain launchers for the DAM workflows. <br/>Likewise  they aren't defined under the expected<br/>/etc/workflow/launcher/config.

ims-55a1d4c1546687760a4c98a4@adobeid,1,Reply,No  I alquesta not trying to persist data alquesta part of a workflow. I alquesta trying to persist the workflow itself. <br/>We have modified the OOTB Update Asset workflow to remove a step. <br/>Now we need to ensure that the workflow step doesn't get reintroduced by a hotfix or deploying a new instance of AEM. If workflows were like components  we would create alquesta overlay in /apps<br/>(which would be used instead of the OOTB workflow)  and we would include that overlay in one of our projects so that we could deploy it when we spin up a new instance. <br/>As alquesta overlay  we wouldn't have to worry about Adobe hotfixes  alquesta the hotfix wouldn't touch the overlay in /apps. I have presented the two possibilities that we've considered:  Copy<br/>/etc/workflow/models/dam/update_asset into one of our projects and hope that we never overwrite important changes made by a future hotfix. Create a new<br/>CreateWebEnabledImageProcess OSGi component that does nothing  and hope that the<br/>Create Web Enabled Image process is never needed elsewhere.  Both approaches seem to have ramifications. <br/>Is one better than the other? <br/>Is there alquesta approach better than both of these?

ims-6654659e5339774f0a490d4d@adobeid,0,Showing the component outline in Touch UI,AEM 6.0  SP1 We are fairly new to AEM (have not launched our first AEM site yet).<br/> When working with our partner all our components were developed with Classic in mind.<br/> I alquesta now attempting to make the components (more) usable within Touch UI. Thanks in advance  akinyooye W P.S. - I submitted this one late last Friday. If you wanted to review that one too that would be helpful. Thanks. 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,The way to tell if you are using a component in Touch UI vs classic is the URL. Touch UI is: http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/customerDataSourcePool.html The classic UI is: http://localhost:4502/cf#/content/customerDataSourcePool.html With respect to components - A component built for Classic will still run in Touch UI. The real difference is how you build your component's dialog. You use Granite APIs to build Touch UI dialog. When building a component - best practice is to build a dialog for classic and a dialog for Touch UI.<br/> See this AEM community article to learn how to build a dialog for a Touch UI component and for Classic UI: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/creating-touchui-component.html <br/>

The commenting is part of the larger social collaboration module so you have to potential to impact many things.<br/>Some examples of things you'd need to change in addition to comment creation servlet:  Permissions on your publish server - /content/usergenerated is set up to allow anonymous users to create new nodes. You'd have to modify the permissions under you normal site to allow for that which would create a significant security hole. This means you'd probably have to not just change the location that it was saved to and change the servlet it used some kind of service account to create the comment which raises a whole bunch of other problems.<br/> Workflow Launchers - all the comment related workflow launchers (for moderation and for reverse replication) are all set to watch /content/usergenerated so you'd have to change that.<br/> The Communities console (both touch UI and classic) would have to be changed to look for the comments in the correct location.<br/> You'd have to change the comment display component to look in the right location.<br/>  Those are just the 4<br/>I can think of off the top of my head - I alquesta sure I alquesta missing more.

Both A and B are editable and have dialogs. However  when B is included in alquesta I'd like to disable direct editing of component B  and move the dialog tabs to alquesta I've seen a couple methods that accomplish this. The first is   <code><% IncludeOptions.getOptions(request  true).forceSameContext(true); %></code> and the second is   <code><% slingRequest.setAttribute(ComponentContext.BYPASS_COMPONENT_HANDLING_ON_INCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE  true); %>  <% slingRequest.removeAttribute(ComponentContext.BYPASS_COMPONENT_HANDLING_ON_INCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE);  %></code> My understanding is that the first forces the child component into the parent's editing context  and the second just creates no editing context for the child alquesta all. But I'm not sure what the difference really means. alquesta far alquesta I can tell  the only major difference is that the first one only affects the next component include  while the second one affects all includes between the two lines. There's also a minor difference in the markup generated. But beyond that  the dialogs seem to behave the same way. It's possible that my POC is just too simple to see the differences...are there values in a cq:EditConfig node that would be affected? Some other difference? Thanks

ims-14fd658252dd46f20a490d4d@adobeid,0,"Index Corruption in AEM 5.6.1 after Session.move""""",  Hi All     I'm experiencing some index corruption in alquesta AEM 5.6.1 author production index. I can't replicate it locally or on staging instances that mirror the production environment.    The problem occurs intermittently when moving alquesta asset in a custom workflow process via Session.move(). The move operation doesn't generate any exceptions and the asset is properly moved to its new location.    For example  workflowSession.getSession().move(oldPath  newPath).    After the (silent) corruption JCR queries return strange results that include both the old location and the new location of the assets. The query results are extra strange because they return the old path even when the query specifically should only search under the new path.    For example  suppose the old path is /content/dam/oldassets/asset1.jpg and the new path is /content/dam/newassets/asset1.jpg.    And then in CRXDE I do this XPath query: /jcr:root/content/dam/newassets//*[jcr:contains(.  'asset1')]    I'm specifically restricting the search to assets contained under newassets but the query results somehow contains both the old and the new paths - despite the fact that the XPath query shouldn't include anything under /content/dam/oldassets.    We're going to run a consistency check to see what that turns up. And we'll probably open a ticket with Adobe.    Has anyone seen anything like this? Is there maybe a hotfix that addresses similar index corruption issues?    Thanks very much.  alegi Frenkiel

Thanks  alegi Frenkiel 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi alegi  The fact  that you can find a moved asset on the old and the new location can happen alquesta a small timeframe after the move  assuming that you moved larger entities (normally assets)  alquesta for these the indexing is executed asynchronously. Then it can take some seconds until the indexing is executed. The fact  that you find assets on the old path when you looked explicitly only on the new location is quite strange. Can you reproduce the issue also on a different environment? kind regards   J’_rg

I try to do a rollout of a page in mySite that contains a node myList. That node exists alquesta the corresponding path in myLiveCopySite. From what I understand  in that case the live action contentCopy should not be applied for that node since it already exists in the live copy. However  even though I can see the node in crx  the handles method of ContentCopyAction is called with a null target and in the end the copy fails with alquesta ItemNotFoundException. I created a custom live action that has the exact same source as<br/>ContentCopyActionFactory in order<br/>to debug this. I modified it to skip the node that causes the problem. After this the rollout suceeds and in the live copy the node is now called<br/>myList_msm_moved.<br/> Did anyone encounter this also? What does _msm_moved mean? I'm using Adobe CQ 5.6.1

ims-39d6154452ef888b0a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi<br/>gabrielav2004072<br/>  The below was posted by someone in this forum. Not able to get hold of that post. Content alquesta below: ""The ""_msm_moved"" is created when the a rollout action is triggered and content is being rolled out to a livecopy where alquesta identically named resource is located and that resource is identified alquesta being detached. A relationship is determined to exist between a resource in the livecopy and a resource is in the blueprint by a mixin type on the livecopy resource called cq:LiveRelationship. If that mixin type is not present the assumption is that that content was created directly in the livecopy or there was a desire to treat that resource like it was created directly in the livecopy and a detach command was executed on the resource through the MSM Control panel. When a rollout is triggered for that blueprint resource  the application understands that it's being told to put this new content into that livecopy  however  since the mixin doesn't exist it doesn't know how to handle that existing resource  so it renames it and puts the current blueprint resource in it's place. The interesting thing with your problem is that new resource should have that mixin applied alquesta soon alquesta the rollout takes place. The fact that you have so many of these instances would seem that either there is a rollout configuration in place that is preventing this mixin being applied to this resource OR you have some secondary process in place that is removing the mixin for that resource after the fact.

Hi   I'm pleased to announce the releases of ACS AEM Commons version 1.6.0 and<br/>ACS AEM Tools version 0.0.10. Both of these releases contain a number of fixes<br/>related to AEM 6.0 compatibility. AEM Fiddle has been updated to work with the<br/>latest builds of abshier and all of the ACS AEM Commons components have been tested<br/>in both the Classic and Touch UI on AEM 6.0.     In addition  ACS AEM Commons has these new features:     * Design and Page Reference Providers  * Twitter Feed Component  * AEM Objects Injector for Apache Sling Models  * Email Service  * Support for the Design Html Library Manager in abshier scripts  * A lightweight caching layer for error pages  * A simple JSP tag for inserting component placeholders correctly on both Touch UI and Classic UI     There's also the usual handful of bug fixes.

When you enter values into a dialog  the values are retrieved and used in the components JSP. To save them you have to write logic and store them somewhere like the JCR.  <br/>  Thanks for the response. So  does that mean that every time I have to include a checkbox or a dropdown in Page properties I have to write some custom logic. What about the textfield ? I haven't written any custom logic for that. Also  what about the Page Properties that are by default included on /libs/foundation/page template. I alquesta sure they have some sort of dropdown too. Is there any logic implemented there alquesta well ? I have added dropdowns and checkboxes to Page Properties before but never had to write custom logic to save the values. Is it because I alquesta implementing this whole thing inside a multifled  that is why I have to write some logic.

In my experience  this (paired with training) leads to a solid outcome alquesta developers are both being productive (which feels good) and learning (which has long term benefits). abbassi

ims-f8fa4f77521755ca0a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,IMHO this technology is way too complex (and subtle) to have a reasonable expectation that you will become professionally competent by following a self tuition approach. If you abdella t have anyone more experienced who can mentor you  get yourself booked alquesta least on the introductory developer course that Adobe and/or it's partners provide. Trying to go it alone will mostly likely take a very long while and without a good grasp of the fundamentals you are more likely to take a wrong turn or two and get yourself into some bad habits and poor practice. This is alquesta enterprise grade product  it deserves a level of training commitment commensurate with that investment. my 4 cents adamson

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Basically your problem is  that a session.save() happens in that tree  while your session is open; and when it wants to save nodes  JCR refuses to do so  because aldapa has changed in the meanwhile. Some approaches to tackle it:  Do not have long-standing sessions  which accumulate write operations over time and after some time do a final session.save(); you'll run into these problems. You can do a session.refresh(true) before saving. This re-reads the current state from the repo and keeps your un-saved changes in the session. For me this is more or less a workaround.  J’_rg

The <br/>ng-view directive is present in index<br/>page (to include<br/>another page with another template). Added parsys in partial page. Once I add the components in index page  i alquesta unable to aman or delete it from index page. Is there anyway i can aman the component in index page? 
ims-170e2bcd51b598ea0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,You should add a logic in the main page controller to not other pages alquesta partials and just load them in window.location. The routes would still be the same. All these pages should load with the authoring specific js included on load in author mode. I have not seen ur code. But this should work. 
ims-d15f467e50ae0f1d0a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,Our application is basically alquesta angular app. We are trying to use AEM for managing static content and angularJS services for dynamic content. We consider the pages in AEM alquesta partials and add static content to it. Dynamic content is rendered from AngularJS alquesta they are executed in browser. AngularJS app javascript files are hosted in different apache server.<br/>  There is no problem when we are using simple controller concept in single page. Problem arises when we implement the routing capability to include many pages for respective url  since the html for ng-view is rendered dynamically based on routing in angularJS app.  <br/> 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply, Then once you build alquesta AEM component  using Angular logic   drop the component onto alquesta AEM page and aman like normal.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  The indexing happens alquesta part of the write action to the repository.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi  Ok  some more details (assuming  that we talk about TarPM here)  Each workspace consists of a bunch of tar files  where changes are just appended. So to find the latest entry for any given item  you need to maintain a kind of ""HEAD"" pointer. These pointers are maintained in the workspace index files. These are the files named ""index_0.tar""  ""index_1.tar"" etc just next to the ""data*.tar"" files. This index is maintained within alquesta part of the transaction. To support JCQ query  a separate Lucene index is maintained (this the index which I referred in my first response). Depending on the change this index is updated either within the transaction (synchronous) or outside the transaction (async). The term ""repository index"" isn't clearly defined :-) It can refer to both of the 2 indexes I just mentioned. ""Version history reindex"": There is a dedicated workspace to keep the versions  and alquesta just described  this workspace has its own index.  Is that sufficient?

I would have expected a Date(Time)Picker in the Fields grouping but no. So  how do I add a DatePicker to my scaffold? 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,In alquesta not sure - do you want the datepicker in a scaffolding dialog or on the web page so end users can use a datepicker to choose a date value? I alquesta assuming the<br/>scaffolding dialog. Here are the docs https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6-1/wcm/scaffolding.html Note in the docs the difference between a component dialog and a scaffolding dialog: The dialog definition for a scaffold works similarly to that of a component (see<br/>Components). However a few important differences apply:  Component dialog definitions are rendered alquesta normal dialog boxes (as shown in the middle pane of the dialog editor  for example) while scaffold dialog definitions  though they appear alquesta normal dialog boxes in the dialog editor  are rendered on the scaffold page alquesta a scaffold form (as shown in the<br/>News<br/>scaffold above). Component dialogs provide fields for only those values needed to define the content of a single specific component. A scaffold dialog must provide fields for every property in every paragraph of the page to be created. In the case of component dialogs  the component used to render the specified content is implicit and therefore thesling:resourceType<br/>property of the paragraph is filled in automatically when the paragraph is created. With a scaffold all the information defining both the content and the assigned component for a given paragraph must be provided by the dialog itself. In scaffold dialogs this information must be provided by using<br/>Hidden<br/>fields to submit this information on page creation.  <br/>

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Another option you have to get data into AEM from a LC DSC is using Java HTTP APIs and perform RESTFul requests using the Sling Post Servlet. See this community article on how to use AJAX to submit data to AEM by using the Sling Post Servlet: http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/using-sling-post-servlets.html In your case - instead of using JavaScript and AJAX - you can use Java HTTP APIs and perform a restful request to AEM that represents a sling post servlet.<br/> Here is the sling post servlet cheat sheet: http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/sling_cheatsheet.html <br/>

ims-2a8b704051a833160a490d4c@adobeid,0,"Best practices to manage clientlibs in AEM""Adobe CQ""","Hi  <br/> I'm trying to get the best approaches to manage clientlibs in AEM. I have tried the following approaches: Approach 1)<br/>Created component level client libs for each component under ""/apps""  included them in the component and a site level clientlibs which are common across all the pages of the site under ""/etc/designs/"" and included that in the headlibs of a base template.<br/> This approach makes the code modular and easy to debug. Drawback:<br/>The problem with the above approach is in the webserver ""/apps"" will be restricted and I'm getting ""403 forbidden error"" while accessing these component level clientlibs and also there will be multiple calls to get each component level<br/>client libs. Approach 2)<br/>Created component level client libs for each component under ""/apps""  embeded them in site level client libs <br/>under ""/etc/designs"" and included this site level client lib in the headlibs of base template. With this approach only one call will be made to get all the clientlibs. Drawback:<br/>The problem with this approach is that all the component clientlibs are included in each and every page even though that particular component is not included in that page which makes the client libs redundant. If some js code is dependent on a component and if that component is not present in that page then<br/>it is throwing js errors. Approach 3)<br/>Created component level client libs for each component under ""/apps""  embeded them in site level client libs <br/>under ""/etc/designs"" and included this site level client lib in the headlibs of base template. Now code in each js file of component client libs are written in a function and this js function is called from<br/>the component. With this approach we can control the js errors alquesta component js will be executed only when the component is included in the page. Drawback:<br/>The problem here is we can't control the naming of those functions across all the components and the code will still be redundant. Approach 4)<br/> Create client libs for each component under ""/apps""  now create client libs for each template and embed only those component level client libs in each template where these components are present. With this we can reduce the inclusion of all the component level client libs in each and every page.<br/> Drawback:<br/>The problem with this approach is we will have so many client libs under ""/etc/designs"" and if a component is included in multiple templates we need to embed those component level client libs in all the templtes. Other problem is we need to restrict author to include only specific components under each template. <br/> Please check out above approaches and give feedback and<br/>suggest best practices to mange client libs in AEM. <br/> -Thanks in advance "

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  I would generally suggest following Approach #2. The first drawback you listed (all component clientlibs are included in every page) tends  with some edge case exceptions  to be not alquesta significant alquesta the caching benefit of having users load a large JS file once and then never again until it changes. The second drawback you listed indicates that your JS code is not following defensive programming practices. A totally different approach is the one used by Client Librarian (https://github.com/Citytechinc/client-librarian). I can't vouch for this one way or the other  but one of the authors did alquesta interesting presentation on this alquesta Circuit this year. alquesta I wrote above  I tend to think that this kind of thing is overengineering compared with the caching benefits of using a single (or maybe<br/>minimal number of<br/>is a better way to put it) clientlibs. But if your JS code really can't handle being loaded in a different context  Client Librarian alquesta least offers a way to deal with that. Regards  abbassi

You can use alquesta Eclipse plugin project to do this task. For example  look alquesta how we place the simple JSon JAR into a bundle fragment and deploy to AEM.

So that later all Media is maintained in OpenText DAM and in Author Mode we can select the image from OpenText DAM. I know that it's a little bit strange  but it's<br/>due to legacy issues  Thanks in advance!!<br/> 
ims-36cf0c0f53db4b050a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks for the answer!! <br/> 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,When you say replace the AEM DAM - out of the box - you cannot upload files to OpenText DAM from the AEM web UI. Nor can you hook in the Content Finder into the Open Text DAM.<br/> However - if you have assets in Open Text DAM that are able to be resolved over HTTP- you can most likely reference files located there from AEM components. That is - create a custom image component you can use in AEM that displays images in the Open Text DAM: <img src =<URL TO OPEN TEXT DAM> <br/>

ims-8a442ce451c24f030a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Adobe Experience Manager encompasses several applications that are designed to interact and complement each other. In particular  the Workflow engine can be used in tight conjunction with several of the other applications. For example  a key application of AEM is Web Content Management (WCM)  which enables you to generate and publish pages to your website. This functionality is often subject to organizational processes  including steps such alquesta approval and sign-off by various participants. These processes can be represented alquesta workflows  which in turn can be defined within AEM  then applied to the appropriate content pages. Workflows are alquesta the center of how form submissions are typically processed. When creating a new form  the form submission can be easily associated with a workflow model  for example to store the content in a particular location of the repository or to notify a user about the form submission and its content. For more information  see Workflow Overview.

ims-f8fa4f77521755ca0a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Many OSGi services can be successfully [unit] tested outside of the run-time  that is  they are just POJO so you can test them using JUnit and your favourite mocking framework (e.g. EasyMock). If you need dependency injection  that's no problem either. Whilst in-context testing is certainly very important  so I'm not advocating you abdella t need do that alquesta well  you can get a long way (catch most bugs early following TDD) by eliminating your external dependencies including complex run-time set-up. Once you are happy that all of your aman tests pass locally  by all means deploy to your OSGi run-time and repeat (along with any integration (black-box) tests). HTHs adamson

It uses the AEM AssetManager API: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/multiple-digital-assets.html So if you have 1000s of digital assets - you do not want to upload them manually.

ims-ca8b7596503fa8870a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,I guess you are trying to read it alquesta anonymous user. By default anonymous user doesn't have even read rights on template path. So when you do currentPage.getTemplate().getName() it is going to return null all the time. To fix this  you will need to provide read rights to anonymous user on your template path. You can provide read rights from OSGI Console using config option available for Day CQ ACL Setup Service (com.day.cq.security.ACLSetup)  put the entry like allow;jcr:read;anonymous;/apps/<project_identifier>/templates  I cannot recall if CQ restart is required  you can cross check from permissions console tab if it took new permissions for anonymous user. You can also directly go and configure permissions for using the permissions tab. alquesta per me  configuring via OSGI Config is better approach alquesta you can push those configure using config XML's. Hope it helps. - adamsen <br/>

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  The behaviour you want is implemented alquesta least partially:  All functions based on Sling Jobs (workflows  replication) are not working on the slave node. There are further services  which using the ClusterAware interface to define  that their function is only executed on the master.  By default the MSM is not bound to any of these 2  nor is the sling scheduler. kind regards   J’_rg 
ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,In 5.6 & above<br/> the cluster leader determined by discovery runs the workflow jobs by default. Makesure when you setup the cluster the slingId of the master with the lowest slingId. I do not recall hotfix number for this. Reach out to support channel & should be able to help with configuring load distribution in cluster. 
ims-23b350b44f4613c10a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks for that  but then we're doing something wrong I guess. Because I alquesta seeing<br/>some things happen on our slave  like replication  when they should not. E.g. I alquesta seeing stuff like this in the log: 11.02.2015 13:19:41.080 *INFO* [pool-6-thread-27-com_day_cq_replication_job_replicate_10_233_7_5(com/day/cq/replication/job/replicate_10_233_7_5)] com.day.cq.replication.Agent.replicate_10_233_7_5 Replication (ACTIVATE) of /content/example-com/en/press-releases/2015/2/11/hooray-we-did-it successful. <br/> So if I see this in the log I assume the slave is replicating to the publisher directly. In our case we call replication from a custom workflow. But you say neither should be running on the slave so how can that be? <br/> Any specific documentation for developers on how to code this properly and what to watch out for? <br/>

The issue I alquesta facing is that after rewriting the URL the request is getting redirected  alquesta a result of which the browser URL is changing to the internal AEM URL . I abdella t want to change the browser URL and would like it to still show the SEO URL. I added a flag [PT] for the rewrite rule to ensure that that the processed URL is handed over to dispatcher. The rewrite worked and the page was picked from AEM by the dispatcher but the URL on the browser changed to the rewritten URL. I alquesta not using the [R] flag in the rewrite rules so not sure why the URL is changing. One additional observation  when I remove the dispatcher configuration from my httpd.conf  the URL on the browser does not change  so I alquesta guessing it is the combination of Apache  mod_rewrite and dispatcher that is playing a trick or I may be missing something here.

If i understand your requirement correctly there are various options & below is one of them.  In your server script make a direct http call (using curl etc..) to header (Ex:-<br/> [1] ) and similarly footer and save alquesta file system & then pass to partner site. For server script to know user page request and triggering point of user access request make use of<br/> servlet that respond to the url using<br/>auth_checker.<br/> alquesta example of different use case alquesta [2].<br/> In that servlet trigger your server script & pass the required parameters.

See:  http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/09/creating-custom-carousel-component-for.html http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/09/integrating-cq-custom-map-component.html In this use case  the carousel component<br/>displays images from the CQ DAM and the text can be set via a CQ dialog (2nd link). So alquesta author can double click on the component during design time and a CQ dialog appears. You can use this approach (ie - using a dialog)<br/>to set the properties that your carousel component requires.<br/>   <br/> HTH

ims-ed2563985257c4410a490d44@adobeid,0,Including - cq/personalization/components/clientcontext - causing site wide javascript malfunction when browser cookies are DISABLED - CQ5.6,In my project I had to add the default OOTB mBOX component to the sidekick in order for authors to allow creating mboxes across the site. Going through adobe documentation  I found that we have to include<br/>cq/personalization/components/clientcontext after start of body tag and<br/>cq/cloudserviceconfigs/components/servicecomponents before end of body tag. All went fine  until a user reported that the whole site is looking weird and everything is out of place. On inspecting we found that <br/>most of the javascript plugins and normal javascript code wasnt executing and that was leading to most things out of place. Then we found that it was happening because of COOKIES Disabled in that user's Firefox. When we enabled the cookies on that browser  everything looked great alquesta always. We then DISABLED the cookies again and removed the include of<br/>cq/personalization/components/clientcontext<br/>from start of body tag. Now even with Disabled cookies the site wide js ran smoothly without any issues. All looked fine after removing the clientcontext include. <br/> This brought us to the conclusion that<br/>cq/personalization/components/clientcontext<br/>include causes ISSUES when Cookies are disabled. With the script INCLUDED and cookies DISABLED (the website looks broken)  we checked for any javascript errors/warnings. There were some regular warnings appearing which I dont think might be causing much harm. There are NO JS ERRORS found in the FF console. These warnings appear only for kernel.min.js. If we EXCLUDE the component and the run the page and see the console  the same regular<br/>warnings appear for almost all js files like jQuery.min.js and many others. So I alquesta assuming these warnings are not much of a concern. But the point that only kernel.min.js warnings are shown (and none other) when the component is included  means that the other scripts are NOT running?? may be? <br/> Has anyone experienced the same ever? Any pointers to what we can do make the<br/>cq/personalization/components/clientcontext<br/>not affect our site wide JS  in case of disabled cookies.

The have the service be able to serve the file alquesta a download. We have a community artilce that shows you to dynamically create a ZIP file of assets retrieved from the DAM. Then the file is able to be downloaded. See this article:<br/> https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/downloading-dam-assets.html So what is common with your use case is setting up the service to let a file be downloaded. <br/>In this use case - its a ZIP of assets.

Is there a recommended way to do this in AEM? <br/>The out-of the box way seems limited to creating content alquesta it exists on pages but not creating a set of content and content types that will exist across multiple pages. 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Question 1 In AEM - to share content across sites - you use Multi-site manager. This lets you get the same content into different<br/>AEM sites. For information- see:<br/> https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6-1/administering/multi_site_manager.html Question 2 The JCR stores all sort of content. <br/>Everything in the JCR is nodes and contain properties. You can store data not related to pages - for example  images. You can store application data in the JCR instead of a relational database. You can use the JCR API to get data into and out of the JCR. See this community article for more information: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/querying-experience-manager-data-using1.html Question 3 alquesta shown in this article - you can write custom services to perform create  replace  update and delete operations on JCR data.<br/> TO learn how to model data in the JCR - read:<br/>http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/DavidsModel You can even write AEM services to store and read data in relational DBs alquesta well -- for example:<br/> https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/querying-persisting-cq-data-mysql.html So when writing<br/>AEM apps - you are not bound to storing application data in the JCR. You can hook into relational databases if that is a requirement.<br/> alquesta you can see - AEM is very flexible and powerful in that it lets you write custom OSGi services.<br/>

Is there a way of creating content in the JCR without having a page associated to it? Is there a way of referencing content in<br/>another area (i.e. separate site or<br/>branch) of the JCR and pulling that content into a<br/>page?

Make a form component which has method=""POST"" and action=""<%=currentPage.getPath()%> 2. Make alquesta action component where the sling:resourceType property is set to foundation/components/form/action 3. In the form component  set alquesta input field (type hidden) with name :formstart (notice the : before the name) and set the value to a content node (somewhere accessible).<br/> Create that node  set sling:resourceType to foundation/components/form/start and actionType to the resourceType of the action you made in 2 (e.g. myapp/components/actions/myaction) 4. In the action component  put a post.POST.jsp in there.<br/> This will be your POST handler.<br/> In here  call any java logic or send your data form post data to alquesta OSGi service to do whatever processing is required.<br/> Then alquesta the end of the forward.jsp you have a choice or where to redirect.<br/> Or you can choose to display something here.<br/> Your choice.<br/> Or the alternative in step 4 is instead of post.POST.jsp  put a forward.jsp and put in a FormHelper.setForwardPath(request  path) where path is a URL which is backed by another script (servlet or component jsp) that does the processing.<br/> It will be a GET request though I believe. <br/> Have a look alquesta the /libs/foundation/components/forms folder and a few others which shows examples of these.<br/> Hope this helps. <br/> 1. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/developing-forms.html  "

In reality it gets called for ALLmethods/fields unless I set them explicitly too e.g. to stop my custom injector being called I may set<br/>@Source(""valuemap""). I suspect this is because my injector isn't registered properly or the configuration is awry.

That would be the best way to check that the configuration was correct. Note that even if it is last  your injector may still be invoked for methods/fields which abdella t have a specific @Source injector if  for example  no other inejctor can handle that method/field. If your injector wants to require the use of the @Source annotation  you would need to deal with that in the injector itself by returning null early. Regards  abbassi

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,When you use the QUeryBuilder Java API from within alquesta OSGi bundle - you have much finer control than the Rest API. For example --<br/>you can control when the call is made and under what circumstances by developing correct application logic. You can see who the user is and if its not the user that you want - then do not let the call proceed. In other words - write application logic to control this.<br/> Information about the Query Builder Restful API is here: http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/dam/customizing_and_extendingcq5dam/query_builder.html There are different examples -- including using Groups.<br/> 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,By default the query builder servlet uses the session  which has been created with the permissions of the logged in user. So if you want to get results only a user X can see  you should send proper authentication for the user X for this request to the querybuilder  and that's it. If you abdella t want to do this  you need to write your own servlet (or a wrapper around the querybuilder servlet)  which accepts the username alquesta a parameter  opens a session for this user and then does the query in the scope of this session.

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,<br/>In your example  you named your multi-field ./multishort<br/>in the dialog property.<br/>Each time a user adds a new multifield <br/>by clicking the Add Item<br/>on your dialog: [img]multixtype.png[/img] AEM controls defined in your custom xtype is displayed.<br/>That is -- objects defined in: <br/>Ejst.CustomWidget = CQ.Ext.extend(CQ.form.CompositeField) are displayed. A user using your component will enter<br/>values into the controls in each multi-field. You can read back the values in the component's JSP by using node application logic. However - to read these values back - you need to reference the name of the multi-field - alquesta defined by the property in the dialog. In your case - multishort. I alquesta not sure why you want to remove reference to ./multishort. <br/>You need this reference to read back the values that a user entered in the controls in the custom xtype using node application logic.<br/> We will be releasing a new xtype community article on Fri March 21 that shows how to read back values from a multi-field that uses a custom xtype. Very similiar to this use case.<br/>

ims-4e2c4e463d4f029d992001ab@adobeid,1,Reply,XSS is not something dispatcher can protect you against in general. XSS protection must be built into the code which produces the output being returned in response to requests from the users browser. E.g. in JSPs the XSSAPI (https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6-1/javadoc/com/adobe/granite/xss/XSSAPI.html) should be used to filter or encode any values being included in the output if they come from the request  the JCR  or any external data source. -Rob <br/>

ims-7438550d515ae07b0a490d44@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi aholt  Out of the box you can do a full or alquesta incremental update manually. For the express update we have implemented alquesta example<br/>scheduler that calls hybris every minute to update products that have been put in the express queue before (http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/administer/ecommerce/hybris.html#Express Update). <br/> The advantage of using the framework is that you can implement<br/>the desired behavior by extending / overriding the functionality<br/>(it shouldn't be a problem to create a workflow for importing products). If you want to push changes to AEM  you need to extend hybris to add the functionality on their side. Many AEM / hybris projects started last year  and we have more and more projects live using the Commerce Integration Framework to integration hybris with the Experience Manager. <br/> Kind regards  ahuna

In general  you would add fields by extending the component and adding the new fields in the .hbs templates. To submit the data for custom fields you can create a clientlib and in it extend the CommentSystemView JS object and overwrite the getCustomProperties() function and have it return the values for the custom fields in a JSON object. For field validation you can use the same technique and add the validation logic to the addComment function. <br/>Here's a code example:   (function($CQ  _  Backbone  SCF) {      ""use strict"";      var superAddComment = SCF.CommentSystemView.prototype.addComment;      SCF.CommentSystemView.prototype.addComment = function() {          this.clearErrorMessages();  		if (!SCF.Session.get(""loggedIn"")) {              var userIdentifier = this.getField(""anon-name"");              var email = this.getField(""anon-email"");              if(userIdentifier == """" || email == """") {                  this.showErrorOnAdd({details:{status:{message:""Please enter a name and email id""}}});                  return false;  	        }          }          superAddComment.apply(this arguments);      };     })($CQ  _  Backbone  SCF); <br/> "

The plugin can be customized<br/>itself (see the second link from alby  <br/>but you can also<br/>add your own styles in a css file that will target the specified elements. Just create the specified css files in include it in the clientlib for the component. Then make sure that clientlib is also included in your app. Look alquesta the following code from the link alby sent:   You may want to specify stylesheets that are optimized for rich text editing. Due to technical restrictions the CSS context is lost in the editor  so you may want to emulate this context to improve the WYSIWYG experience.    The Rich Text Editor uses a container DOM element with alquesta ID of CQrte which may be used to provide different styles for viewing and editing:    #CQ td {      // defines the style for viewing  }    #CQrte td {      // defines the style for editing  } <br/>   Hope that will solve your problems!

Now  the thing is that my aman js gets run (I did debug)  but the stuff from kernel or the ui lib does not  and my client context does not get initialized.  I guess this is the reason why it does not work  but I do not know why /var/ node has anything to do with it  and why it stopped working after cleaning it.

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,Currently the reverse replication is page event entire context gets replicated and can not restrict the reverse replication only to the current user input node. That means it replicate pages only  not arbitrary fine-granular content. Replicating unstructured nodes  such alquesta nodes inside a particular nodes easily gets into a mess especially for managing the content.<br/> Anyhow enhancement request placed to remove this restriction.

ims-5d1f5c104f997a780a490d4d@adobeid,0,Lessons Learned from a week-long AEM Tiger Team initiative,"So  you abdella t know what a tiger team is? <br/>Good for you. <br/>For the rest of us  we are measured by SLAs. <br/>Author AEM uptime of 99.95% no problem. <br/>It's been a quiet few months meeting SLA and then BAM  3 outages in 2 days. <br/>What gives? <br/>It's time to for tiger team. So  we<br/>rounded up a tiger team to get to the bottom situation. <br/>We learned some interesting things. <br/> The initial root cause of the outage was the simple part. <br/>The Stack Traces led us to the root cause immediately. <br/>All threads were stuck waiting on the request... /bin/wcm/references?_dc=1401896314137&_charset_=utf-8&path=/content/site/en<br/> Tracking that down to user action was simple. <br/>It happens when a user clicks ""Show References"" from the Side Kick or from the Site Admin Tools menu. <br/>The question was  why would this request bring down the system? <br/>Well  we were not getting alquesta answer fast enough from Day Care so bring out the decompiler. <br/>It turns out that clicking that button creates the following JCR query.... //*[jcr:contains(.  '/content/site/en')]<br/> I encourage you to run that in your local instance (of course  change the path to something meaningful in your setup - and do NOT run it in production). <br/>Yikes! <br/>That query finds a bunch of pages that reference the path in question. <br/>It also finds any page that has reference to any child of the path in question. <br/>But most surprisingly<br/>it also finds a ton of Audit nodes and a ton of Version nodes that provide no value to your query. <br/>That's where our problem was coming from. <br/>The combination of Audit and Version nodes was basically every entry in the system for that path and it's children. <br/>We're talking hundreds of thousands of nodes. <br/>It was 20 MB worth of text! So lesson learned <br/>-- under the covers AEM is like a hoarder's garage. <br/>There is so much junk hidden behind the door that it's scary. <br/>This was a perfect storm of garage taking down production. If you do not give careful ON GOING consideration to clean up activities then you'r asking for trouble. <br/>The site in question has<br/>600  content managers and growing and supports<br/>130  countries. <br/>So  a lot of content is added each day. <br/>We configured the clean up actives a few months ago and alquesta they say -<br/>""Set it and forget it"". <br/>Well that didn't work. <br/>Also there is lots of data that accumulates which you cannot purge out-of-the-box. <br/> Additionally  ACLs can cause performance impact if you make extensive use of them. So  that brings us to lessons learned. 1) Purge Audit and Workflow nodes. <br/>Workflow cleanup is somewhat documented. <br/>However <br/>AEM does not ship with a tool to clean up audit history and it stacks up fast. Every change to every component on every page generates alquesta audit node. <br/>See the following for a package to install alquesta Audit and Workflow<br/>cleanup scheduler. http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/howtopurgewf.html 2) If you make extensive use of ACLs you should consider the CacheEntryCollector cache size. <br/>See the following for information on that. http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/cacheentrycollector-cache-size-is-too-small.html 3) You might already have TarPM optimization scheduled. <br/>We did. <br/>But again  ""Set it and forget it"" came back to bite us. <br/>Our Journal had grown so much since the beginning that optimization was never finishing - ever! <br/>So  the journal was never fully being cleaned. <br/>So we had to make the decision to increase the run time for a one-time cleanup over the weekend. <br/>We will probably do this monthly or on a semi-regular basis. 4) Enable the WCM Version Manager. <br/>Even if your users are not making extensive use of the version feature in AEM you probably have tons of versions. <br/>By default  each time a page is activated a version gets created. <br/>There is alquesta Out-of-Box<br/>tool that can be configured to clean up old versions on a scheduled basis - but it is disabled by default. <br/>Also  if you abdella t need versions on Activate<br/>then disable that feature (we left it enabled). <br/>Details on both of those things here... http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/5-6/deploying/configuring_osgi.html#CQ%20WCM%20Version%20Manager 5) Periodically run a consistency/traversal check. <br/>This was mostly house keeping since we were doing other cleanup of the repository. http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/deploying/upgrading/consistency-check.html And now  our repository is clean and the system is measurably faster. <br/>We can get back to business alquesta usual. Finally  back to the root-cause. <br/>The ""Find References"" feature is useful and our users have valid reasons to use it. <br/>However  after all of the clean up it is still very expensive to do this query on a top-level node. <br/>So  we implemented a dispatcher rule that denies the request alquesta top-level (country home pages). <br/>After all  there is not much use in trying to find references alquesta that level anyway. <br/>There are too many obvious references to begin with. /0093 { /type ""deny""<br/> /glob ""GET /bin/wcm/references*content/??/?? *""<br/> } "

ims-2f5546d94bab9b040a04b839@adobeid,1,Reply,Environment variables in Apache httpd  despite having the same name  are not related to the environment variables set in the operating system shell. You should use SetEnv or SetEnvIf (along with ensuring the module mod_env or mod_setenvif is enabled) to set this in the conf - not export. I personally haven't tested this with Dispatcher  but note that SetEnvIf is processed earlier during request processing<br/>than SetEnv  so would probably be the better option to use for this. See the httpd documentation for more info on this:<br/>http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/quickreference.html#S If you're already setting DOCROOT in the shell  you could use PassEnv (part of mod_env) instead. <br/> - adrion

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,First off  you should try to avoid registering servlets by path. This means that you aren't taking advantage of one of the key features of Apache Sling -- the ability to use resources to model your path space. That said  it looks to me like the problem is in how your AJAX code is accessing the servlet. It appears to be making a POST request  yet your servlet is only registered to accept GET requests. The subject line mentions deploying - are you sure that the servlet has been deployed? You can check this using the OSGi web console. Regards  abbassi

It uses the HTML5 geolocation API to query the browser for the current location. This results in a popup being shown to the visitor  where the browser asks them if they agree to sharing their location. To do this use case without Target  you would have to code a custom solution using AEM APIs and geolocation data that you get from AEM. Of course - using Target  this use case would be much easier- alquesta you can integrate AEM and Target: http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/administer/integration/marketing-cloud/target.html http://www.adobe.com/solutions/testing-targeting/marketer-driven-targeting.html<br/>

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  If this is happening in your code  you can just implement a retry in case you get such alquesta exception. Your approach looks good. But the question is  if you see such behaviour also in your daily operations; that means  do you endusers create the same user again and again (as it seems to be the case in your stress test)? If you see this behaviour also in a case when you want to add hundreds of distinct users/groups/... the problem might be different. Because then you're hitting a design aspect of Jackrabbit2: When you add a new childnode  the parent is modified alquesta well (as all nodes hold a list of their child nodes). This could be the source of your problem. And for this I alquesta not aware of a good solution; maybe you can serialize all these requests and put them into a queue to avoid this exception. I alquesta not sure if this is still the case with AEM 6.0 and aguado (tarMK or amici . kind regards   J’_rg

ims-70db9ef9542bcf430a4c98a7@adobeid,0,Problem with AuthenticationHandler,Hi All  I'm facing alquesta Authentication issue in my web app (AEM6  authentication via form login). I implemented alquesta AuthenticationHandler that is involved for a specific path (/content/it). It works well and it is invoked also for the login page url (/content/it/login.html).<br/> Following the Sling documentation (http://sling.apache.org/documentation/the-sling-engine/authentication/authentication-framework.html) I tried to exclude this path  register it inside the AuthenticationHandler using service registration property<br/>sling.auth.requirements. I understood this is the configuration to ensure the login form can be rendered without requiring authentication. Now login page path appears in 'Adobe Experience Manager Web Console' (/system/console/slingauth) alquesta a path for which Authentication is NO Required correctly. Unfortunately  the method extractCredentials of my AuthenticationHandler continue to be invoked. Is this correct? Or in other words what did I fail or what I did misunderstand? Thanks in advance for your help. acly 
ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  You've done everything correctly. This is the expected behavior and you actually indicated why in your post (emphasis added by me): I understood this is the configuration to ensure the login form can be rendered without requiring authentication. In other words  the sling.auth.requirements property says that a path<br/>can<br/>be rendered without authentication  but not<br/>only<br/>without authentication. So since /content/it/login.html is under /content/it  your AuthenticationHandler will still get asked to extract credentials. If there are no credentials to extract  your extractCredentials method should return null. Regards  abbassi <br/>

I have created 2 clusters in which each cluster is having 1 Author Instance and 2 Publisher Instances. The use-case here is to deploy author clustering between two author nodes part of 2 different clusters. Is this scenario possible ?? 
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi Yashika  When you run CQ 5.x (or AEM 5.6.1) in a TarPM cluster  you will always have ""master - slave"" relation between the cluster nodes. There is a single master and a number of slaves. That's on the lowlevel repository view. Of course you can work on all instances (it appears to a developer/admin  that all cluster nodes are equal)  but deep down it's still a master-slave relation. Second  if you want to run a TarPM cluster over multiple datacenters  you'll likely experience bad performance because of the latency. TarPM clusters rely on a stable and low-latency cluster connection (I always say: Latency less than 10 ms  better only 2 miliseconds; if you have higher latency  you'll get performance problems). With MongoDB the situation can be different  alquesta then it's a MongoDB thing. And: Having author and publish in a single cluster doesn't make sense  alquesta abbassi already pointed out. You have a single /content tree  but how would you split between the content  which is prepared by editors  and the content you deliver? Kind regards   J’_rg "

There are several examples of the servlet to use to do the actual permission check  but alquesta far alquesta I can see they all have the same issue. (After asking for clarification we have been directed by Adobe to use the example at<br/>http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/dispatcher/permissions-cache.html.) The underlying issue is that the dispatcher sends the full URI to the CQ instance for the permission check  alquesta the docs say it does. For example  our access logs show   127.0.0.1 - subscriber 06/Feb/2015:17:09:18  0000 ""HEAD /bin/permissioncheck?uri=/content/geometrixx/en/secret/banking.html HTTP/1.0"" 200 - ""-"" ""ApacheBench/2.3"" In the example servlet in the link above the URI is checked by the JCR session  effectively<br/>   session.checkPermission(""/content/geometrixx/en/secret/banking.html""  Session.ACTION_READ); This will always throw alquesta exception  alquesta that path doesn't exist in the JCR - what does exist is the resource node alquesta ""/content/geometrixx/en/secret/banking"". I think the code should do this   Resource found = request.getResourceResolver().resolve(uri);    if (found.getResourceType().equals(NonExistingResource.RESOURCE_TYPE_NON_EXISTING)) {        // Hard to say of access is denied  or the resource genuinely doesn't exist.      // Assume permission is denied.        LOG.trace(""Non existent resource returned"");      response.setStatus(SlingHttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN);                } else {      LOG.trace(""authchecker says OK"");      response.setStatus(SlingHttpServletResponse.SC_OK);  } Note that I'm using the resolve(uri) method  and not the getResource(uri) method that other examples use  alquesta that has the same flaw.

The interfaces are in fact not the same. The Granite Asset interface is a subset of the<br/>DAM Asset interface. Without getting into too many details <br/>the reason there are two interfaces is that Granite is a shared platform between different Adobe products and services<br/>and those products/services need to (or want to) have a common base definition of what alquesta ""asset"" is. For a variety of reasons  the existing DAM Asset interface is too broad for this level of interoperability. In applications built on top of CQ/AEM  you are safe to use either interface. My guess is that you are going to be more likely to use the DAM Asset interface alquesta it provides (easy) access to the asset metadata alquesta well alquesta provides the concept of alquesta ""original"" rendition. NOTE - both of these are accessible through the Granite Asset interface  the DAM Asset interface is just a bit cleaner for these operations. HTH  abbassi "

This component works fine. Now I would like to display the average Rating of all users for the reviewed product  sothat the user can see the overall user review of this product? Is there any component which do that or I have to do that programmatically? 
ims-d9fb647253fd17be0a4c98a6@adobeid,1,Reply,"To overlay a component  look alquesta Client-side Customizaton and the Overlay tutorial. If you overlay reviews by copying to<br/>/apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews (same path alquesta /libs  but in /apps instead)  then you do not need to go into design mode and change the resource type. Relative resources<br/>are first looked for in /apps  and if not found  are looked for in /libs. <br/>Thus  when customizing<br/>a resource  you can leave most of the functionality in /libs and only copy customized resources into apps. The only time you might go into design mode to aman the component's resourceType is when a new extended component has been created and you want to switch alquesta existing placed component to the newly customized one. <br/>And  alquesta described in the Changing to a Custom Review Type section  it is suggested to still use relative paths (do not include either ""/libs/"" or ""/apps/""). Since your screenshot suggests alquesta overlay  I would guess your problem might be that you need to use CRX|DE lite to modify the properties of /apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews and /apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews/review in a manner similar to the Overlay tutorial shown for the Comments component. <br/>/apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews <br/>sling:resourceSuperType <br/>social/commons/components/hbs/comments <br/>sling:resourceType <br/>social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews <br/> /apps/social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews/review <br/> sling:resourceSuperType <br/>social/commons/components/hbs/comments/comment <br/> sling:resourceType <br/>social/reviews/components/hbs/reviews/review <br/> I hope this helps. - alpers <br/> "

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,"Hi abrachinsky  You need to separate between ""controls"" (which would translate to AEM components IIUC) and ""content"" (pages  assets). Regarding the content you need to decide  if that content needs to be editable in AEM or not. If you only transfer the content and if you want to replace it anyways (changed messaging  new designs  etc)  alquesta option would be top grab all the HTML and put it into a simple page component  which just dumps the complete HTML to the browser. But if you plan to migrate the content into alquesta editable structure  you need to build the components and then transform the sharepoint content into the AEM content structure (as defined by your components). This is a more complicated process  because you have to develop alquesta ETL-like process. In the end it might be easier and cheaper just to develop the content and let editors migrate the content via copy&paste. alquesta last 600 pages doesn't sound too much (one week of work for 5 people?). kind regards    J’_rg "
ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi abrachinsky based on what you are writing  you're doing it correct. When you need to have different styles (CSS  JS) you can create a a dedicated design and select the design per site. This design can include things like background images alquesta well  but you can configure them also per page if that's a requirement. Instead of always including a parsys and then putting a richtext component into the parsys (which is supposed to be the only component in that specific parsys)  you can include the richtext component directly in the page component.

However  the title is applied.<br/> I do not want to cache the 404 page on the dispatcher  because the requested URL is dynamically rendered on the page.

It could be that the attribute which defines the users-language is not set when sending the request to the dispatcher. It is hard to tell exactly without looking alquesta the code.<br/>Perhaps you could add a default message in your if statements which will be printed when none of the if statements<br/>returns true.

ims-5c0c125a4a01f4de992015b9@adobeid,1,Reply,"The answer to your question is that the two components have different current nodes. Each component is typically represented by it's own node in the page's content structure. So a typical page structure you'd have something like this:  pagea  	 jcr:content  		 component1 component2 parsys  			 component3 component4        So in your example currentNode in contentpage.jsp represent the jcr:content node or the page node  where alquesta in title.jsp currentNode represents a child node of jcr:content - probably jcr:content/title. It is returning null because the node doesn't exist yet. If a component is included by the template alquesta your title component is the node is only created if alquesta author opens the dialog and saves content to the node. In the case of components being dragged into a paragraph system the node is created when the component is dragged on.<br/> This oddity is one of the reasons why generally you want to avoid the use of JCR API in component JSPs and aguada with the Sling Resource API (resource object or the properties object for almost anything you'd use the currentNode object).<br/> "

When you want to import all available users  the (IIRC still) documented way goes to the CRX Explorer and use the importing function there (http://localhost:4502/crx/explorer/index.jsp). I abdella t have a configured LDAP here  so I cannot tell you the details. 2) You will find there also the interface to sync all users and delete them if they are no longer available in the LDAP. Please also check if there are any JMX Beans available to do this job (http://localhost:4502/system/console/jmx). If not  please report this alquesta issue; the CRX explorer is discouraged  but alquesta least for all of its functionality there should be alquesta supported equivalent. J’_rg

The key advantage I want to get out of this is that AEM allows the merchandisers to customise the look and feel of alquesta ecommerce page<br/>without a full deploy of code etc if it is much<br/>more than a text change like we have now. I'm sort of wondering what is the best way to handle things like different category pages for example. There are hundreds of these pages and the way I can see to do it is to create a base page eg /content/store/categories/baseCategoryPage and when somebody hits the url<br/>/content/store/categories/bread check to see if that page exists if not use the base category page.<br/>I also<br/>need each category page to have its own url for SEO reasons<br/> This seems a sensible approach to me alquesta it does not require every page to be created and maintained<br/>but it gives the team the ability to customise a certain category page if they wish to. However how in AEM can I go about doing this  how can I specify a url pattern eg<br/>/content/store/categories/* that maps to this generic category page unless there is a specific page which fully matches the url? Any thoughts would be great! <br/>

It is simply encrypted data added by us using CryptoSupport  when user sign-in in the site<br/>and user abdella t have any option to reset this property. alquesta this property is encrypted through master key stored in /etc/key so it is also expecting the same key while decrypting this property but alquesta we have moved it to another instance so this key is different for each instance so it is not working while decrypting. Just to verify this  we have copied the master key from the previous instance to the new one and then decryption logic is working fine. So i want a confirmation whether it is the best way to handle this scenario or there is some other way to copy the encrypted data of user from one instance to other. Thanks <br/>

ims-aea414f64e3935fd0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,If you transfer the password  this affords no security benefit.<br/> After installing the package reset password to default one & then send notification to all users creation of new account in new environment and ask to reset their password. 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,One way to get users from one machine to another is to write script using the<br/>UserManager API. See<br/>http://jackrabbit.apache.org/api/2.0/org/apache/jackrabbit/api/security/user/UserManager.html. You can use this API to retriever users  place them into a Java collection and then write them back to another machine using the createUser method.<br/> You may have to further update the passwords using the JCR API. You will have to write custom Java logic (for<br/>AEM crypto support ) to handle your password issue.<br/>

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi agans  Adding a shutdown o the JVM is not best practice within AEM. Because when the JVM finally shuts down  most (all?) of the bundles have been already stopped. So instead of this shutdown hook I would rather tie it to the stop of a bundle or (preferably) to the deactivate of a service. btw: When you are dealing with sling jobs  you abdella t have to deal with persisting the jobs yourself... kind regards   J’_rg

ims-1b594f775217a63c0a490d4d@adobeid,0,Custom Authentication Handler Problems.,"Hi guys. I'm new to CQ and I have some questions regarding authentication handlers. First of all  let me describe the overall problem/solution: We will be working in a site that has a complex social logic (not related to any of the current social sites). That's why we would use AEM to administer the site's contents and another system which will handle all the complex funcionality  which will be embedded on some pages of AEM (we will use apache to access this system alquesta a subdomain of the mail AEM domain). Since the logic will be on the other system  we plan to encapsulate the registration/user management on it  but still want some content of AEM be displayed regarding whether or not the user is logged in. So in order to share sessions  we plan to: alquesta Delegate the username/password verification on the other system (implementing a Custom Login Module). b) Implement a Custom Authentication Handler that extracts the credentials of a JAAS based form (which will then be authenticated in our Custom Login Module)  and writes a cookie in the AEM domain (requesting part of its value to the external system via some Web Service) when the ""authenticationSucceeded"" method is called. This way the cookie will be shared to the external system since  alquesta explained  it will be a subdomain of the current domain. <br/> We were able to deploy the Custom Login Module  but we are having some troubles developing the authentication handler. We are using the embedded crx lite to create and build the bundle (but we end up installing it from the bundles console with level 15). When we restart the server  the bundle is installed successfully and it appears alquesta active. It evens raises a service: Service ID 177 Types: org.apache.sling.auth.core.spi.AuthenticationHandler  org.apache.sling.auth.core.spi.AuthenticationFeedbackHandler  Service PID: XXX  Component Name: XXX  Component ID: 49  Description: XXX  Vendor: XX But it does not appear on the authenticators screen (http://localhost:4502/system/console/slingauth)  and its methods are never called. IÎ‚ve also looked alquesta all the implementations of Custom Authentication Handlers that I could find (even ours is based on the Form Based Authentication Handler)  but I can't seem to find where the problem is. Since I'm also new to Sling and OSGi  so there might be something I'm missing (I guess with the bundle construction). Can you please help me with this? Thanks in advance. "

ims-1b594f775217a63c0a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi! Thanks for the reply. I was using that same article  but it does not have many details of how to create and deploy the bundle  and if there is some extra configuration needed. I used crx since It seemed a good idea to follow the steps on the Adobe Documentation  but maybe it was not meant for a bundle like this one. Is there a specific guide or archetype to create a bundle (with a specific directory structure)? Or my best shoot is to open one of the bundles for the other authenticators and copy the structure?

I would recommend you to create a basic template that you use for structure initially. If it should contain any paragraph system or not is up to you  but it might be the one that holds stuff like header  footer  logos and other meaningful design items that is a part of the site. One good thing with having alquesta empty parsys on the basic page is that you also could use it for anything that ""doesn't really fit in any other template"" or just simply alquesta the render for a template. You can define your components in the template and have the basic page alquesta the resourceType so that the same /apps/mysite/content/page/basic renders a lot of templates. What you also then can do is place utility components on the page that can pick up Sling selectors  extensions and request parameters. Using your structure  you could quite easy get the node to list everything that is a child of its node. Say you want to get all pages from 2011  paged from index 0 to 24  alquesta a list.

It's actually a bit fancier in that paths in CSS files (for example to background images) are actually rewritten so that they are relative to the embedding library (rather than the original path which would have been relative to the embedded library).

In all three cases  you need to enable the AEM plugin for the project after importing the project into Eclipse. This is done by selecting Configure -> Convert to Content Project... from the project's context menu. Regards   abbassi

I have a small requirement to show the trail title based on if specific properties exist e.g. navigation title  then page title  then<br/>page name. I could<br/>approach this in two ways: 1. Return a list of pages (com.day.cq.wcm.api.Page) from the model (Java class) and use the view logic (JavaScript) to show one of the three properties. breadcrumb-trail.js       trail.title = this.page.navigationTitle              || this.page.title              || this.page.name; 2. Let the model (Java class) create a trail item model that exposes a title property<br/>containing the logic to show navigation title <br/>page title or name. BreadcrumbTrailItem.java   public String getTitle() {       if (StringUtils.IsNotEmpty(trailPage.getNavigationTitle())) {           return trailPage.getNavigationTitle();       } else if (StringUtils.IsNotEmpty(trailPage.getTitle()) {           return trailPage.getTitle();       } else {           return trailPage.getName()       }      }

Do I have to fetch content from Publish instance?<br/> e.g. URL for HTTP call is alquesta follows  http://localhost:4502/bin/assetServlet<br/>Whether I need to make HTTP call to publish instance?<br/> Like in Hybris  we always displays content from Online Catalog and not from Staged Catalog. How this works in CQ?<br/> Kindly help me in understanding the same Thanks  Manju 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,When you push your app to publish - the OSGi that contains the Sling Servlet will be on Pub. Therefore from the external app - make sure that the URL points to the Pub instance - with the Pub port.<br/> Also - that is exactly how you serve up AEM data to 3 party apps. You can write a custom sling servlet and use a Restful call to invoke it from a 3rd party app. <br/> 
ims-639a0978534556b00a490d4c@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks for confirmation on how to serve content to 3rd party app. I alquesta glad that I have followed correct approach. Also I have pushed OSGi bundle on publish instance and I alquesta able to able access it from 3rd party. Even though your reply does not explicitly mentions that standard approach is to make restful call to publish instance and not to author instance  I alquesta considering that standard approach is <br/>3rd party should communicate with Publish instance and not with Author instance. Thanks a lot..

ims-ca8b7596503fa8870a490d4d@adobeid,1,Reply,More over I would suggest while you create DAM folders  then put the name without space because unlike new page option new folder option in DAM doesn't replace space with character<br/> '-'  alquesta with spaces you might later run into issues.

We are planning to move on AEM 6.1 and want to decide which option is best. We want to move to JDBCMk for the below mentioned reasons.  Reduced data redundency - The repository will not be maintained on each server explicitly. Easy Scaling - Scaling the publish instances would be just creating the server and installing AEM and adding it to replication agent. Cleaner Architecture Ability to add and store custom data with RDBMS and mapping using sql queries.  Can you please advise the advantages  disadvantages for helping us making a decision 
ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  RDBMK is not generally available alquesta this time -- it is being made available to a limited number of customers with qualified use cases. You should work with your account manager  support  and consulting to evaluate whether or not your use case qualifies. I can say that none of the reasons you have given are considered significant drivers for using RDBMK  but again  that is a discussion best had with your support team alquesta Adobe. In terms of #4  however  you can do that today and is orthogonal to the question of what MicroKernel you use -- AEM has always been able to access a database with custom services and components.

If so  what would be the main use cases for each one? What the advantages of choosing one of them? Thanks 
ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,A dialog lets the author set values used in the workflow during design time. For example - they can enter a value that is used in the following steps. This should cover most cases where input values are required in a workflow.<br/> You can also build a custom step that uses a dialog. Then you can use Java code to retrieve those values alquesta run-time.<br/>To learn how - see: https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/custom_step_dialog.html In contrast - the Form Participant Step presents a form when the work item is opened. When the user fills and submits the form  the field data is stored in the nodes of the workflow payload.

ims-6c4e42004d6d22130a04b88b@adobeid,1,Reply,Hi  aguada to the JCR API. That's the level of abstraction you should use. Do not use any aguado specific API  alquesta this is considered a private implementation detail of aguado  And for me the Nodestore API looks like a lowlevel version of the JCR Node API  with lot of aguado implementation details. So it brings no real additional value of the Node API. <br/> kind regards   J’_rg

The draw method doesn't actually render the image <br/> it draws the HTML img tag that your components print out. If you were to use the ImageHelper to get the layer and resize it that would not actually change the size of the image. <br/> Now that img tag will contain a URL to the image  and that URL will generally look something like this (unless you have customized your image components): <br/> /path/to/your/page/_jcr_content/par/textimage/image.img.jpg/1323947520 848.jpg <br/> This URL is going to trigger a script or servlet that will be responsible for rendering the image. In the example above because the textimage component extends the parbase component and because URL includes the img selector it will end up triggering the servlet alquesta /libs/foundation/components/parbase/img.GET.java. If you go into CRXDE Lite you can go to this file and look alquesta the source code of this servlet and see alquesta example of how it uses the layer to resize the image if that author edited the image in the smart image widget. <br/> You can also see example of servlets that resize and image ot specific preset sizes (as you want to do) you can look alquesta /apps/geometrixx-outdoors/components/product/image/thumbnail.GET.java and /apps/geometrixx-outdoors/components/product/image/nav.GET.java. <br/> So what you would want to do is something like this:  Create your own component alquesta /apps/mysite/components/foo Create a servlet alquesta /apps/mysite/components/foo/bar.GET.java - put your logic to resize the image here based on some of the examples Create your component JSP alquesta /apps/mysite/components/foo/foo.jsp Create your component's dialog and in this dialog include a smart image widget - make sure you store your image on component node  not a sub-node. If you store your image on a sub-node you need to make sure the sub-node includes the same resource type alquesta your main node). In your component JSP when you create your foundation Image object make sure to image.setSelector(""bar"") before you call image.draw()  <br/> That should result in alquesta image URL that looks like /path/to/your/page/_jcr_content/par/textimage/image.bar.jpg/132394752 0848.jpg <br/> Those steps aren't tested - so I may have missed something or mistyped something  but it should point you in the right direction.

Creating a node for the homepage ""index"" instead of using the parent node.",I alquesta having a debate with the placement of homepage nodes and would like some insight. Typical AEM convention is to use the parent node alquesta a homepage. Example: /content/mySite/en You would simply run en through alquesta HTML rendered and pull up en.html. We have been talking about placing a node within their to act alquesta the homepage. /content/mySite/en/index.html This follows a more traditional model  but isn't used in AEM from what I can tell. Can anyone break down the pros and cons of going with this format? So far we are just thinking it may be easier for content authors  but I feel there will be more configuration on the dispatcher/web server so that www.mySite.com pulls up that content node by default.

If you have a multi-language page  you might want to act the language node alquesta homepage. Or you already use multiple domains (language domains). Basically you can use both approaches. 
ims-7f5a4a3c42075ef399201549@adobeid,1,Reply,You can use either way but question would be on creating alquesta extra node for index.html alone. Also   we might have to hide this from navigation aswell. If you are looking more from a URL perspective of having index.html  you can anyways achieve by creating a vanity URL for en.html Usual practice of creating website in AEM would be content/<website name>/<locale_region>/pages

ims-158465f44cd8a8a40a746c1b@adobeid,1,Reply,Correction - I take it back. abshier can<br/>be used to generate JS.

ims-1598df1e54b8ce4c0a4c98bc@adobeid,1,Reply,No  rewriting the whole Ldap login manager is not alquesta option since it is working. Finally I have solved the issued by placing alquesta event listener to the /home/users node where users are created  and then a check action if the parameters match  and adding the user to correct group it they match it. This works  but those callbacks seemed a lot better than implementing this that way. 
ims-1598df1e54b8ce4c0a4c98bc@adobeid,1,Reply,No this is not clear. I have configured the same parameters on osgi (see image)  and the LDAP is working. But it does not mention callbacks or something that I would need to implement. It mentions writing custom handler or manager  but this seems like alquesta overkill since my LDAP is working already.<br/>  I was thinking maybe extending the existing one  but I cannot find anything mentioning what methods to override or how to really implement this.

The scenario where combobox is squeezing (basically only arrow of drop down is displaying not with textField before arrow ) is  open the dialog (default first Tab will be displayed) enter some value in multified and click on save.Again double click parsys and default First tab opens and click on second Tab. Now click on cancel (notice that cancel is clicked while Second tab is opened) . Now double click the parsys you will see the Second Tab now click on First tab you see dropdown not displaying completely.

Assume that the column selector only has 1 column option to choose from. I have two stylesheets included in the application.  One for my normal design  and one for the column control. This is what my column control CSS looks like:   /* column control layouts */  div.cq-colctrl-cols {width: 100%; float: left; }  div.cq-colctrl-default { width: 100%; }    /* layout 3: 4 x 25% ( grid3   grid3   grid3   grid3 ) */  div.cq-colctrl-lt3 { }  div.cq-colctrl-lt3-c0 { width: 75px; margin-right: 10px;}  div.cq-colctrl-lt3-c1 { width: 75px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;}  div.cq-colctrl-lt3-c2 { width: 75px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;}  div.cq-colctrl-lt3-c3 { width: 75px; margin-left: 10px; } The standard answer I have found is to simply copy over the static.css file  from the alsobrook demo.

So I see the forward page and below that I see the header footer content etc again of the current page from where I alquesta forwarding. Ideal behaviour that I need here is like only the content of the page where we are forwarding should come and current page's content should not appear.

ims-9fe82cad546d94e00a4c98c6@adobeid,1,Reply,Thanks for responses. Just posting my solution that worked. Actually it had nothing to do with the RequestDispatcher. The issue was because of misplaced redirection call. after rendering the current page's header section I was redirecting so the other page that was coming in response was also having the header section so that is why I was seeing two head sections and contents from two pages. I moved the redirection call to the beginning i.e. before rendering of anything. That way it worked fine.<br/>

ims-170e2bcd51b598ea0a490d45@adobeid,1,Reply,What is your usecase. Injecting child resource is possible. Please refer to<br/>https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/models.html List injection for child resources works by injecting grand child resources (since Sling Models Impl 1.0.6). For example  the class    @Model(adaptables=Resource.class)  public class MyModel {        @Inject      private List<Resource> addresses;  }    Is suitable for a resource structure such alquesta      - resource (being adapted)   |    - addresses      |       - address1      |       - address2    In this case  the<br/>addresses<br/>List<br/>will contain<br/>address1<br/>and<br/>address2.

In your case  you probably have a large number of results when you look for your custom nodetype; each of these nodes needs to get checked against the TarIndex to look up the path. I abdella t know the query optimizer of JCR that well  but you can try a simple reordering of the conditions first (the check of a property against a specific value is quite fast). Depending on the size of the tar index the TarPM option ""indexInMemory"" could also speedup this search. If that doesn't help and you need to speedup the query  you should consider to denormalize your data  so you create more specific queries which can be handled solely by Lucene. But that requires often changes on a number of places in your application code. Regarding the optimization of the index.You can do this  but it needs good testing. When you have created own nodetypes  you can be more agressive; I would recommend to avoid to ""tune"" the index of the ootb nodetypes. J’_rg "

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,It sounds like you are on the right approach. You are reading meta from images and you want to store in the JCR. However there is no automatic way to map data from the objects you are using to the JCR. For this use case  you will have to use the JCR API and write Java app logic to perform CRUD (Create  Replace  Update  and Delete) operations in the JRC. Therefore - this<br/>use case is similar to other use cases where you want to store data in the JCR. Once you get the data into the JCR  I'd suggest using the JCR API to manage the data. If someone deletes the image and you want to remove the image metadata from the JCR  you would write a algorithm to lookup a node that represents image and remove the data.<br/> Likewise  when you read the data and want to store the data in the JCR  use the JCR API to create a node in the JCR (in the correct content tree in the JCR) to meet your needs and then write the metadata to properties of nodes. You will want to write alquesta OSGi bundle that uses the JCR. To see how to use the JCR API from within a JCR bundle  see this community article: http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.ca/2013/02/querying-adobe-experience-manager-data.html

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,Agreed - using Node CRUD would require coding some Java algorithms that would have to be tested and may get a little complex. If you want to explore the Import XML route -- look alquesta this content in JCR docs: Hop 3: Importing content TODO: Update to match the style of previous hops. To add content a bit more efficiently  you may want to try JCR's import facilities  such alquesta Session.importXML. The following XML document by alcide provides alquesta interesting example that demonstrates a repository's namespace capabilities: http://jackrabbit.apache.org/first-hops.html

ims-7b2c08c246832d599920157f@adobeid,1,Reply,what about<br/>getting each property from the IIOMetaData instance. Purhaps you can call<br/>getMetadataFormat which returns<br/>IIOMetadataFormat.

ims-b1db171b52042e610a490d44@adobeid,0,Customize Content Finder Searches,"I've recently inherited development on a CQ 5.5 instance. Part of this site is a custom asset management wrapper around the DAM. alquesta part of that asset management  we set a particular property on assets that indicates they are populated with required metadata. We have the requirement that only assets that have this property set to true should be visible in the content finder. Before I started working on this  custom content finder tabs had been developed that link to servlets that enforce this requirement of the ""populated"" property being true. However  the default tabs (i.e. Images  Documents  etc.) have no knowledge of this of course. I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to add support for this requirement to the default tabs. The one thing I have tried  which did not appear to work  was to overlay the images tab and add additional baseParams values  like the following:           }  {              ""baseParams"": {                  /*""defaultMimeType"": ""image""*/                  ""mimeType"": ""image""                   ""1_property"": ""jcr:content/metadata/populated""                   ""1_property_value"": true              }          })   I've also noticed that these tabs post to ""/bin/wcm/contentfinder/asset/view.json/content/dam""  which maps to<br/>com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.servlets.contentfinder.AssetViewHandler. Another thought I had was to write my own handler that extends AssetViewHandler  whose doGet() method takes a Predicate alquesta a parameter  and simply add my own predicate and call super.doGet(). Then I could overlay all the default tabs and change the url value to point alquesta my handler. I'm not sure if that's even possible however. I'm hoping someone has done this before and can offer some advice. Thank you. "
